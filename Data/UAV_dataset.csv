1,3,"Extracting pitch, roll & yaw data for image mosaic",3,1136,1,"Aloha, I’m a grad student at the university of Hawaii and I’m using a 3DR X8+ with a FLIR thermal imaging camera with Teax thermal capture data collection system connected to it. It is being used to map cold water anomalies along the coastline of Maui. I’m working with a couple professors on this project and we have been attempting to mosaic the images I’ve collected so that they can be georeferenced for surface area calculations in ArcGIS, but there are a lot of difficulties involved. The biggest issue is that the camera is not set to be triggered by the copter as per a normal aerial mapping mission with the X8 mapper setup due to the type of camera and data collection system being used. Mosaicing is not going as planned and I am now attempting to access the pitch, roll and yaw data so that we can use that info to project the images appropriately. The main problem I’m having is understanding the format in which the tlog files are created when exported out as a CSV file format and opened in excel. I need to attempt to link images with the corresponding pitch roll and yaw by comparing time stamps of the tlog file with the image data files. Is this a lost cause? or is there an easy way of extracting out just the basic pitch, roll, yaw, lat and lon in a format that is understandable and perhaps user friendly?

5,5,Tuning large 36Kg X8 drone seeking advice,15,5331,1,"I have been working on the construction of a rather large X8 drone which has an AUW of 36Kg. The test payload in this scenario has been 20lbs. Details of configuration: T-Motor U11 120kv motors in an X8 coaxial configuration. T-Motor 26x8.5 props T-Motor 80A Flame ESCs Pixhack flight controller with firmware 3.3.2 Mission Planner: 1.3.37 4x 22Ah 6s battery packs. These are being used in two series pairs to run the motors at 50V The 50V power is going through a UBEC in order to power the flight controller with 12V, as 50V was rated too high for the PM sensor. I instead use telemetry via the transmitter/receiver to monitor system voltages. This past weekend the weather was good enough to go out and do some flying. We tried to auto tune the system in order to improve its performance. But this has resulted in a lot of oscillations. After conducting an auto tune, the system seems perfectly fine. I then land the aircraft with the auto tune channel still high, and disarm in order to save the PID values. Then when I go to fly again, the system oscillates aggressively - even though the values were not doing this prior to landing and confirming the saving. This problem may be echoed in this forum thread: * Some people blame firmware 3.2 and indicate that problems went away after reverting to 3.1. However, I am on firmware 3.3.2. I do not know if these problems continued in 3.3, or if there is anything related to the problems they are describing. Because the auto tune takes a very long time for this particular machine (almost 10 minutes per axis), I end up doing each axis at a time while auto tuning. For reference, I have provided links to videos and DataFlash files from each step taken. All DataFlash files can be downloaded here: * I first started off performing the auto tune on just the roll axis. Video of this can be seen here: * The dataflash file from this flight is titled ‘2016-03-20 - 01 Auto tune Roll Axis’. After saving the new PID values for the roll, I went to perform the auto tune for the pitch. However, when I took it into the air, the system had extreme oscillations on the roll axis. Even though the PID values were fine at the end of the roll auto tune - as before landing these values are active so that the user can test them to see if they like it. However, once the controller has been cycled and the PID settings saved, heavy oscillations occurred. You can see this behavior in this video: * Dataflash file - “2016-03-20 - 02 Oscillations Roll Axis” The wiki indicates that if I am seeing vibration, to try lowering the ‘RC_FEEL’ value in the software to a value of .25 As the default is 50, I first tried a value of 25. This change had no effect, so I tried .25 This too had no effect, and so I reset it to 50. I then took a screen shot of the PID values for the roll axis, reset them to default, and then moved on to trying the pitch axis. The pitch axis went the same. Video can be seen here: * DataFlash file - ‘2016-03-20 - 03 Auto Tune Pitch’ As you will see at the end of the video, after landing and saving the PID values, the system shows extreme oscillations on the pitch axis. Again the PID values are documented, and then reset to default in order to proceed with the next axis. We then did the yaw axis. Video is here: * Dataflash file is titled ‘2016-03-20 - 04 Auto Tune Yaw’ Once again, at the end of the video you will see the resulting PID’s after landing and saving results in extreme oscillations. To see the PID values each axis auto tuned with, check out the screen grabs in this folder: * Probably my biggest concern when flying the machine is the fairly rapid loss in altitude when changing position in the roll or pitch directions. When in ‘altitude hold’ mode, the system goes down on an angle whenever I attempt to fly it around the field. And so we tried to adjust the ‘Altitude Hold’ gains manually. We moved the default of 1.0 to 1.2, to 1.5, and finally 2.0. I could not see any improvement, but we unfortunately ran out of batteries by this point. It did feel that landing the aircraft became more challenging as the value increased, but it is hard to know for certain. Video of these trials can be seen here: * DataFlash file is called: ‘2016-03-20 - 05 Altitude Hold Adjustments’ My next thought is to assign the ‘P’ value of each axis’ PID value to a channel 6 knob on the transmitter in order to manually adjust the gains during flight in order to try to dial out these oscillations. This may also prove to be a good way to try and improve ‘altitude hold’ performance. I see a lot of people saying poor altitude hold performance is often due to vibration issues on the flight controller. However, the values in the dataflash logs (except when the oscillations occur) seem to be pretty good I think. I think vibration issues are to blame for aircraft which raise or lower altitude on their own without any input whatsoever. In other words, the system simply rises or lowers while the throttle is at mid, without even trying to fly the aircraft in any particular direction. I think in our case, it is just not giving enough signal to the motors to maintain the altitude. Currently the weather here is not very good for flying, and so I thought I would share my efforts thus far in case someone may have some insights or advice on what steps I might try in order to improve the handling of this aircraft.","Hi, I think there is an issue with output saturation on the large copters.

Is it drones of this size (~35Kg) that this solution targets? In the meantime, my strategy is to reset all the PID values to their default. I would then assign the channel 6 knob to tune one axis’ P value. I was thinking of setting the low point to be the default, and the high point to be what the autotune solution was last time.

I can see some higher frequency oscillation in your quad at 11 and 17 Hz. I suspect we can reduce the bandwidth of your control without impacting your performance given your large weight. I have a bunch of parameter updates I would like you to try. I can’t upload a parameter file so I will put them below. Copy them into a .param file and upload them to your copter. Please be very careful when you first take off after these parameter changes as they will affect your tune. Your voltage reading on your battery looks funny.

Details of configuration: T-Motor U11 120kv motors in an X8 coaxial configuration. T-Motor 26x8.5 props T-Motor 80A Flame ESCs Pixhack flight controller with firmware 3.3.2 Mission Planner: 1.3.37 4x 22Ah 6s battery packs. These are being used in two series pairs to run the motors at 50V The 50V power is going through a UBEC in order to power the flight controller with 12V, as 50V was rated too high for the PM sensor. I instead use telemetry via the transmitter/receiver to monitor system voltages. This past weekend the weather was good enough to go out and do some flying. We tried to auto tune the system in order to improve its performance. But this has resulted in a lot of oscillations. After conducting an auto tune, the system seems perfectly fine. I then land the aircraft with the auto tune channel still high, and disarm in order to save the PID values. Then when I go to fly again, the system oscillates aggressively - even though the values were not doing this prior to landing and confirming the saving. This problem may be echoed in this forum thread: * Some people blame firmware 3.2 and indicate that problems went away after reverting to 3.1. However, I am on firmware 3.3.2. I do not know if these problems continued in 3.3, or if there is anything related to the problems they are describing. Because the auto tune takes a very long time for this particular machine (almost 10 minutes per axis), I end up doing each axis at a time while auto tuning. For reference, I have provided links to videos and DataFlash files from each step taken. All DataFlash files can be downloaded here: * I first started off performing the auto tune on just the roll axis. Video of this can be seen here: * The dataflash file from this flight is titled ‘2016-03-20 - 01 Auto tune Roll Axis’. After saving the new PID values for the roll, I went to perform the auto tune for the pitch. However, when I took it into the air, the system had extreme oscillations on the roll axis. Even though the PID values were fine at the end of the roll auto tune - as before landing these values are active so that the user can test them to see if they like it. However, once the controller has been cycled and the PID settings saved, heavy oscillations occurred. You can see this behavior in this video: * Dataflash file - “2016-03-20 - 02 Oscillations Roll Axis” The wiki indicates that if I am seeing vibration, to try lowering the ‘RC_FEEL’ value in the software to a value of .25 As the default is 50, I first tried a value of 25. This change had no effect, so I tried .25 This too had no effect, and so I reset it to 50. I then took a screen shot of the PID values for the roll axis, reset them to default, and then moved on to trying the pitch axis. The pitch axis went the same. Video can be seen here: * DataFlash file - ‘2016-03-20 - 03 Auto Tune Pitch’ As you will see at the end of the video, after landing and saving the PID values, the system shows extreme oscillations on the pitch axis. Again the PID values are documented, and then reset to default in order to proceed with the next axis. We then did the yaw axis. Video is here: * Dataflash file is titled ‘2016-03-20 - 04 Auto Tune Yaw’ Once again, at the end of the video you will see the resulting PID’s after landing and saving results in extreme oscillations. To see the PID values each axis auto tuned with, check out the screen grabs in this folder: * Probably my biggest concern when flying the machine is the fairly rapid loss in altitude when changing position in the roll or pitch directions. When in ‘altitude hold’ mode, the system goes down on an angle whenever I attempt to fly it around the field. And so we tried to adjust the ‘Altitude Hold’ gains manually. We moved the default of 1.0 to 1.2, to 1.5, and finally 2.0. I could not see any improvement, but we unfortunately ran out of batteries by this point. It did feel that landing the aircraft became more challenging as the value increased, but it is hard to know for certain. Video of these trials can be seen here: * DataFlash file is called: ‘2016-03-20 - 05 Altitude Hold Adjustments’ My next thought is to assign the ‘P’ value of each axis’ PID value to a channel 6 knob on the transmitter in order to manually adjust the gains during flight in order to try to dial out these oscillations. This may also prove to be a good way to try and improve ‘altitude hold’ performance. I see a lot of people saying poor altitude hold performance is often due to vibration issues on the flight controller. However, the values in the dataflash logs (except when the oscillations occur) seem to be pretty good I think. I think vibration issues are to blame for aircraft which raise or lower altitude on their own without any input whatsoever. In other words, the system simply rises or lowers while the throttle is at mid, without even trying to fly the aircraft in any particular direction. I think in our case, it is just not giving enough signal to the motors to maintain the altitude. Currently the weather here is not very good for flying, and so I thought I would share my efforts thus far in case someone may have some insights or advice on what steps I might try in order to improve the handling of this aircraft.","Hi Mike, Large is now 30+kg.

Because this X8 operates at 50.4V, I have had to use a BEC to regulate the voltage first for powering the controller. Perhaps this is why the voltage reading looks funny. I use a voltage telemetry through my transmitter / receiver instead to get the actual feedback from the system. Do you have a particular timeline for needing the results from this test? I am leaving my country in the morning for a few weeks, and return around April 20th. As such, it may take some time to try out these parameters. Just to be clear, which DataFlash file were you looking at which showed the oscillations? Was it during an autotune session, or was it the file “2016-03-20 - 02 Oscillations Roll Axis”?",756,7,0,14,2h,31,176,1,2,3,10,0.3333,0

It is getting close, but I am struggling with altitude hold on the system. Whenever I apply pitch or roll in altitude hold mode, it drops altitude immediately. Here are some of the things we have tried:  Autotune. This resulted in heavy vibrations as described before. Manual tuning. This worked out much better. The pitch and roll are responding well and feel very responsive. Setting the altitude gain value to the channel 6 knob and attempting to adjust in flight. No results. If set high enough, it causes the altitude drop to still happen, just faster. Tried settings advised above - resulted in crash. Tried to adjust the throttle gains as per the documentation - resulted in crash. Checked vibrations in logs. They are completely fine. Believed barometer was faulty, and switched out for another flight controller and went to the latest stable firmware. No change. Believed that perhaps it was a balance issue (too bottom heavy), and took off weights until it was completely balanced. No change. This problem does not exist in stabilize mode. The aircraft flies well, has loads of power for fast vertical climbs, etc. In altitude hold mode, it climbs slowly. Went into software and adjusted the rate that it will climb in altitude to its maximum in case the system was not getting enough power to adjust altitude while moving. No change.  Summary: As mentioned, the system shows real performance in stabilize mode. I have actually never hit full throttle, because it climbs REALLY fast - even with the 20lb test weight attached for an all-up-weight of 35Kg. In GPS mode, it holds altitude for the most part, but it also flies VERY slowly. I know this can be changed in the software though. My current theory as of yesterday is this: I believe it is a barometric issue, but not a hardware fault. The flight controller is positioned near the center with the top propellers a little higher than it. I think perhaps this system pushes so much air that it creates it’s own low-pressure bubble even when it is not close to the ground. I think that perhaps as I pitch or roll, the flight controller moves into the low-pressure bubble. This makes the flight controller believe that it has gained altitude and so lowers in elevation. When it settles, the barometer gets the actual barometric pressure and then rises back to the position it should be at. For example, when in altitude hold mode, if I input throttle during the pitch or roll movement to adjust for the drop in elevation, after the aircraft settles, it will rise up to the even higher elevation than when I started instead of maintaining a constant. I think I do not see the altitude drops in stabilize mode because it does not use the barometer in this mode. And I believe I do not see such drastic drops in GPS mode because it is moving so slowly and so the flight controller rarely moves into the low pressure bubble to its side (or at least does not enter this low pressure bubble fast enough). I would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions. If my theory is true, any advice for equalizing the air pressure? Foam or something similar?",3188,48,0,14,2h,31,176,1,2,3,10,1,0

All DataFlash files can be downloaded here: * I first started off performing the auto tune on just the roll axis. Video of this can be seen here: * The dataflash file from this flight is titled ‘2016-03-20 - 01 Auto tune Roll Axis’. After saving the new PID values for the roll, I went to perform the auto tune for the pitch. However, when I took it into the air, the system had extreme oscillations on the roll axis. Even though the PID values were fine at the end of the roll auto tune - as before landing these values are active so that the user can test them to see if they like it. However, once the controller has been cycled and the PID settings saved, heavy oscillations occurred. You can see this behavior in this video: * Dataflash file - “2016-03-20 - 02 Oscillations Roll Axis” The wiki indicates that if I am seeing vibration, to try lowering the ‘RC_FEEL’ value in the software to a value of .25 As the default is 50, I first tried a value of 25. This change had no effect, so I tried .25 This too had no effect, and so I reset it to 50. I then took a screen shot of the PID values for the roll axis, reset them to default, and then moved on to trying the pitch axis. The pitch axis went the same. Video can be seen here: * DataFlash file - ‘2016-03-20 - 03 Auto Tune Pitch’ As you will see at the end of the video, after landing and saving the PID values, the system shows extreme oscillations on the pitch axis. Again the PID values are documented, and then reset to default in order to proceed with the next axis. We then did the yaw axis. Video is here: * Dataflash file is titled ‘2016-03-20 - 04 Auto Tune Yaw’ Once again, at the end of the video you will see the resulting PID’s after landing and saving results in extreme oscillations. To see the PID values each axis auto tuned with, check out the screen grabs in this folder: * Probably my biggest concern when flying the machine is the fairly rapid loss in altitude when changing position in the roll or pitch directions. When in ‘altitude hold’ mode, the system goes down on an angle whenever I attempt to fly it around the field. And so we tried to adjust the ‘Altitude Hold’ gains manually. We moved the default of 1.0 to 1.2, to 1.5, and finally 2.0. I could not see any improvement, but we unfortunately ran out of batteries by this point. It did feel that landing the aircraft became more challenging as the value increased, but it is hard to know for certain. Video of these trials can be seen here: * DataFlash file is called: ‘2016-03-20 - 05 Altitude Hold Adjustments’ My next thought is to assign the ‘P’ value of each axis’ PID value to a channel 6 knob on the transmitter in order to manually adjust the gains during flight in order to try to dial out these oscillations. This may also prove to be a good way to try and improve ‘altitude hold’ performance. I see a lot of people saying poor altitude hold performance is often due to vibration issues on the flight controller. However, the values in the dataflash logs (except when the oscillations occur) seem to be pretty good I think. I think vibration issues are to blame for aircraft which raise or lower altitude on their own without any input whatsoever. In other words, the system simply rises or lowers while the throttle is at mid, without even trying to fly the aircraft in any particular direction. I think in our case, it is just not giving enough signal to the motors to maintain the altitude. Currently the weather here is not very good for flying, and so I thought I would share my efforts thus far in case someone may have some insights or advice on what steps I might try in order to improve the handling of this aircraft.","The solution is to use the latest stable firmware, configure it correctly like described in the wiki, then configure the dynamic notch filter, test it.

I had the same issue using the ppm converter (please don’t use) and or the esc only using one ground,v+, and signal and the rest just signal. It causes a de-sync and the multi rotor will flip, pitch, or roll at any given moment. I solved it by using all 3 wire BEC leads.  I have 14 Pixhawks running and no issues since.

You must provide a signal ground on any flight controller - anything else is unsafe. You don’t have to connect the center wire (5v) if you don’t want to. Doesn’t seem to hurt anything, though. You might want at least one connected, if you want to take advantage of PIXHAWK’s ability to fail over to a different power supply.

Looking at the * something doesn’t look quite right but I’m not sure how it should be. Just in case here is my *. Thanks, Gal","First off, this is only the .tlog with these values. A .bin file with the RCin and RCout values logged would be preferred. When you say All motors calibrated numerous times and also before flight on the field. What are referring to? Do you mean you calibrated the ESC’s at the field? As the motors run when doing the motor test it doesn’t seem the PixHawk has a faulty output. The only other thing I can think of is that you are being too cautious in your attempt to take off. It can be a bit daunting for the first flight, but even the big octo’s will tip on their very first lift off. You need to arm then ‘jump’ the copter into the air. Not too hard, just aim for a metre high to get it out of ground effect. To play it safe, when on first lift off and the copter wants to tip, say forward, I will back off and then raise the throttle again with some back elevator added. Usually the copter will want to tip backwards then. So I know the controls are working in the correct sense. I usually check the roll that way as well. When I am happy that I have control I will give the throttle just enough to get it light on its feet, then a little ‘punch’ to clear the ground quickly to a metre high.",1195,1,0,1.8k,13d,3.9k,26.2k,159,281,38,1.7k,1,0

So, I just now did the same test again but removed 7"" gemfan 2 blade props and set drone on 6"" Lumenier 3blade gate breakers. Behavior changed completely, i can tell it flew way better and had no oscillations, at least no audible ones. can it be because motors span faster? those are 2300k motors after all, they want go fast. may be with 7"" props it was out of proper zone? looking at vib 3.3 chart from log below i cannot say this looks much better than the previous sample. and z vibes seem to be comparable. but, like i said - in the straight line shoot drone did not scream oscillations and went well straight like accelerating and maintaining altitude. in first test it was all over the place up and down. so something was off, but what? blades were new in first test - not bended and seemingly well balanced, as stable loiter was very steady. But there was nothing like that in the previous glitch with drone giving up suddenly 130A max current to all motors. i really cannot comprehend what could possibly do such a stunt, what combination of cafeterias would be able to cause this? i do not see any error or msg at mark 36 on first log where current shows that spike - and i killed motors in .6 sec after it screamed and jerked into sky… but, on those 3 blade gate breakers i flew faster now and way more aggressive, did circle and stab and alt hold - all was perfect. i do not know what to think, as it is unsafe to fly this thing anywhere as it is armattan - unbreakable frame, but i cannot fly it anywhere if it may jerk up 100m up and then be dropped down on the populated area. plus i cannot think of anything acting like that since may be very first 3.1 arducopter RC versions - pos hold was extremely reliable since 3.3 for me, i never had anything weird like that.",2298,0,1,301,4d,387,6.5k,4,101,26,623,1,0

I look at this chart - and in the sample here it took this model to go almost over whole football field to pick up enough speed to get this effect - at the mark 29 on this graph it picks up max speed, and then i give it full brake. GPS.Spd shows how it stops, at same time VIBE.VibeZ goes all way up. But before all that at mark 26 it shows normal loiter - on new props and new mounts all vibes are under mark 7 - as good as i can get it. What i do not get at all - vibeZ goes up at braking, understood, but,  model starts climbing altitude even before VibeZ maxes out and clips out at value 30 - what drives this behavior? it begins at value 25 about time mark 29 1/3. It looks to be something specific for position hold logic, as i tortured this model in acro and stab mode to push it way harder and it was able to fly fine maxing out current on ESCs, with no such weird issues. Of course vibs do get higher as model pick up speed, there is nothing to do with that, but why it results in such a response as to give extra throttle and climb up? I tried to play with filter values on gyro and accel, and ended up back with gyro to be at 80 and accel at 40 - it seems to show least amount of weirdness, but, it is still looking odd to me. i admit i never had a chance to tune such racer small fast models, it seems to be very different from 800kv or 315kv heavier slow drones. i am trying to understand if there are any parameters that may affect this scenario and what factors contribute to this issue. it was a challenge even to get it into the air, thanks to Leonard who actually gave some advice here: *  otherwise it would not even fly at all. I do not expect arducopter to be a betaflight - but i can see how in stab and acro modes it is working acceptably fine, as i pushed this model to max current there and it responded decently enough, so this altitude jerk in pos hold has to be something caused by some code logic related to some parameters or filters, perhaps? vibes will raise with speed, it is a given. is there anything that can be done here or only solution would be to lower max speed for pos hold to tame it down and avoid those issues by reducing max speed? logs here *",2245,2,1,301,4d,387,6.5k,4,101,26,623,1,0

Its a quad on 330KV TMotors and autotune is also not an option due to desync possibility (I had it happen to me). I had similar issues, excellent stability in stab and alt hold but wobble or relative quick correction on loiter mode. By manually tuning (map channel 6 to a pot) I changed Rate Loiter P to 0.720 (from 1.0) and also reduced Rate loiter I to 0.440 (from 0.500). This resulted in a much more locked in loiter with far less aggressive correction when hit by wind or even just on windless days (since I had the wobble even on windless days). Although I followed the instruction on how to manually tune, after saving the new settings and rebooting the quad, the I value now changed all by itself to 0.000. Seems like a bug in MP because I saw the same happen on a different occasion to the P value. So in both cases, I re-write those parameters in the full parameter list (because the extended window will not let me change it) and save them again. That keeps it then and shows up in the extended window too.",1076,584,0,15,1h,10,55,0,1,8,8,0.6667,0

I tested this quite a bit with a helicopter set up for full manual control in Acro for bailout, and flying under a 250kV interstate transmission line to get a GPS glitch and see what the EKF “lane switching” does. My solution was to disable the extra EKF processes. Getting rid of the extra EKF processes, I found, will still cause the attitude solution to go bonkers when you get the “GPS glitch”. But the helicopter remained controllable when it can’t switch to a different attitude solution via another EKF process. Until the over-reliance on GPS is designed out of the system, and GPS is only used for horizontal navigation (GPS is not even reliable on altitude), there is not an easy “fix”. The reason your attitude solutions are significantly different is because the accel’s don’t agree. If the IMU’s don’t agree, the attitude solutions will be far enough off to cause quite radical upset when it switches",1029,0,1,1.5k,37d,3.1k,25.8k,24,507,33,2.7k,1,0

It’s easier to see on a heli because the servos go wild when it switches. And in my experience a noisy IMU can cause it. OTOH, when the accels agree right on, the EKF can switch and you can’t even tell it happened. It is possible you have a hardware problem there. I’ve had some cheaper Pixhawks that show the type of IMU noise/aliasing that yours shows in helicopters, and those have been really interesting to fly when the EKF suddenly decides to swap lanes. GPS glitch can be logged for various reasons, but it usually means the GPS position has become unreliable for some reason. The system is designed to cope with that, but it isn’t necessarily designed to cope with hardware that is not working properly. When you have dual IMU’s they really should both show the same thing. It might be worth it to try a different controller and see if you can get rid of that IMU noise.",1029,3,0,1.5k,37d,3.1k,25.8k,24,507,33,2.7k,1,0

Then, a couple of seconds after the primary EKF switched multiple times (see Figure 1). * This caused major oscillations on the copter and we finally crashed. We found that there’s a significant delta between the estimated attitude of both EKFs. So, switching from one to the other causes significant discontinuities in the actual attitude estimation. Figure 2 shows the estimated pitch for both EKFs and we clearly see that there’s a drift between them. Indeed, looking at our previous dataflash logs, we observed that most of the time. * In the short term, we just disable the second EKF. However, we still want to investigate that further. The log file is available here: *  Questions:  Why does a GPS glitch causes the primary EKF to change? What can cause so much difference in the estimated attitude of both EKF?

Perhaps it didn’t get enough points, or it was done too close to something magnetic?  I think they are (roughly) microteslas. The “compass” is a 3-axis magnetometer. It yields a 3-dimensional magnetic field vector, which is the vector sum of the earth’s magnetic field, the magnetic field of anything that happens to be on the vehicle, and any bias inherent to the sensor. So, we subtract off the latter two, the body-fixed magnetic field errors - that is what the offsets are. In addition, we have compassmot, which lets you subtract off the dynamic magnetic field from high-current power wires in your power distribution. We will also eventually have scale factors - of note is that your Z-axis magnetometer is scaled by 20% - pretty bad, but luckily it is the Z-axis, which doesn’t matter very much much.",825,8,0,45,3h,33,1.0k,0,6,2,643,1,0

Thanks, Ed","Update: I have completed several flight and have run into some different issues and when they are resolved I will pick this one back up. I put in the new compass offsets and flew it.  It flew well, but I was not paying much attention to MP (hard to see), ran the battery out and crashed it.        In my defense, the battery indicator in MP still showed about 20% although the voltage was very low.  It survived surprisingly well.  During rebuilding I noticed that some of the screws seemed to be magnetized, so I removed the upper level screws and heated them up on the stove.  That wasn’t working too well, so I moved them to a spoon over a candle.  Eventually they stopped showing attraction to a kitchen knife. I reran the wizard and all the setup calibrations, worked out a few more bugs.   Hosed my telemetry radios by attempting to increase the air and baud rates via MP.  Now neither respond in anyway to MP although their lights appear to show that the radios are communicating with each other.   I went for another flight without telemetry and it worked well.  As I was coming down for a landing (LAND mode), it freaked out and crashed.  What I think happened is that a micro crack in the frame from a previous crash caused a motor/prop/end of arm to break off.  At least that is how it very briefly looked while crashing and how it ended up when I retrieved it. So compass fixes are on hold until I get new frame bits and I resolve the 3dr telemetry radio issues. Thank you very much for your help. Ed",1512,20,0,0,< 1m,0,11,0,1,3,8,1,0

HAGL is the “estimated height above ground level (m).” The other two are range finder data. As you can see the error occurred as the HAGL spiked and the drone crashed. the NKF5.rng and RFND.DIST1 have both spiked before but did not cause any reaction by the drone. Prior to that, the drone was hovering at wasite height using optical flow and sonar. As I gave a pitch input, the drone dashed forward, smashed into the ground and then dragged itself into a wall. Very exciting. I’m still analyzing the log, but this looked like a problem. Anyone else with the same experience? Is this a known bug?

There is an imbalance between each pair of motors.1+2 are working much less than 3+4 to maintain a level hover.You can see that at the end of the flight.That could be an accelerometer calibration problem (can’t see one in the parameters) or the motors running slightly out of plane.Maybe a bit of twist on the motor mounts ? Maybe as simple as getting the CoG right before take off (much easier to do on a hexacopter   ). I also found some stuf I don’t understand in the servo outputs.Correctly listed as the four motors but the other figures look like a Taranis calibration set whereas mine look like pre-set firmware values.I haven’t got a clue about those numbers or whether they only come into effect if using the channel for something switch operated.

Jagger’s mention of accelerometer calibration sounded hopeful because I didn’t feel I had done a particularly good job calibrating it when I first assembled the copter.  So I took my time and recalibrated the accelerometer as carefully and accurately as I could.  I also put together a (very) simple rig to evaluate CofG.  Left side/right side was well-balanced but the copter was heavy on the back end (no jokes here).  I correctly this by sliding the battery forward when I strapped it in. I also recalibrated the radio and changed the endpoints to 1100/1900, with 1500 as center.  This is now reflected in the RC MIN, MAX and TRIM values.  However, the SERVO values Jagger mentioned are unchanged.  And they do look like the raw numbers out of my Taranis radio.  I’m confused about the purpose of the SERVO values.  I can see they are supposed to represent the individual motors but beyond that I have no idea.  Information on this topic is pretty sparse. Anyway, I flew the copter this afternoon and much as I hate to admit it, the motors still show an imbalance.  The numbers are very similar to those in the previous log.

I used a simple servo consistency tester (the kind where you can dial in an arbitrary pulse width) and a digital gram scale (the kind you can buy on Amazon for less than fifteen bucks, preferred by drug dealers, I’m sure).  The same ESC and battery were used throughout.  To test, I would simply put a 1045 prop on upside down, zero the scale and take measurements. Anyway, the results definitely support your suggestion.  Motors 3 & 4 are weaker than 1 & 2, with 4 being the weakest by far.  This is only my third build, but I used EMAX motors on a 250 quad without running into this problem.  They ship already configured for CW or CCW props.  The CW shafts are reverse threaded.  The reason I mention this is perhaps the CW and CCW motors run down different assembly lines.  Not that this would excuse the difference, but it might explain it. I want to say thanks for all the support I received.  I doubt I could have resolved the issue without it.

As your’s sound a bit iffy you could swap the ESCs about and see if it’s them.There’s not a lot to go wrong on a motor bar a dead short or a collapsed bearing but the ESCs are minefields of possible faults.An underperforming diode can rob power.So can a FET or a solder joint.If a component is getting ready to blow (and there are plenty on an ESC) I can see it dropping available power to the motor.So a set of cheap mini ESCs may be a good investment.A set of 20A mini ZTWs is very reasonable at the minute for instance. Nearly all of my motor failures have actually been ESC failures.Sometimes with flames.And smoke.Only one was when I stabbed the windings with an overlong screw.User error - please replace user and start again. But don’t let me discourage you from buying some expensive great quality motors.Just an example.I haven’t got a set.Yet. You’re welcome for the help.It’s what Ardupilot is all about.

This flyaway occurred on a dji s900 setup with an authentic Pixhawk fc, dji hardware, and an ImmersionRX Ezuhf diversity receiver. I’ve flown this setup countless times in loiter, auto, and stabilized flight modes without problem. My transmitter is a Taranis Plus with ImmersionRC EzUhf transmitter module. I always fly with missionPlanner open and connected on a ground station laptop and have had success with using that radio connection for flight mode changing / auto mission waypoint selection. * Now for the flyaway. * from partway through the flyaway. The Diversity monitor I was using at the time of the flight didn’t have a DVR so the only dvr I have is when it was already out of sight and I grabbed my FPV goggles and started recording with its DVR. The craft was on an auto mission (~200 meters away) when it suddenly tipped forward and to the right and then started acting very weird (while in auto ie shouldnt have been happening). I immediately switched to loiter which gave limmited control and I tried to bring it back to me. It still wasn’t responding correctly though and so I switched to stabilized mode which still yielded little to no control. The craft wasn’t losing altitude, just not responding correctly to my commands. At this point it had come back and was only about 100 meters away from me at about 200 feet altitude. At this point I could see from its FPV feed, from a hard mounted FPV cam, that my attempts to yaw or roll the craft with my transmitter in all flight modes were not having any effect on it. As the radio was having no control of the aircraft I tried switching the craft to guided mode and flying home via my groundstation laptop with no success. I then tried switching the mode to RTH from the ground station with still no success despite the ground station receiving full telemetry of the aircraft. At this point I switched to failsafe mode on my transmitter, but the craft continued to switch itself back and forth between loiter and stabilized mode rapidly. It passed me at this point in the opposite direction of its auto mission and then seemed to get stuck in stabilized mode and started flying full throttle away at a 24 degree heading (I’ve had the transmitter in RTH mode for a while now). It ended up flying full throttle for about 12 minutes before coming down about 3 miles away. I have looked at the logs in mission planner etc and can’t figure out what exactly happened.

I am more curious why it doesn’t show up in the Vibe log but the IMU are way too high and Vibe clipping started when things went south. The repeated switching between compasses would indicate a compass issue. Have you done a motor/compass calibration? I noted that in the crash log you didn’t have the compass switching. It was the pitch that started to oscillate out of control, although the roll was not good, just not out of control before the pitch. The frame is not overpowered, running at about 1600 to 1700 PWM values. If this is without payload it is going to be struggling with another 2kg. Could it be that it has been tuned to be running nearly flat out? Have you tried it with a dummy 2kg? You are going to have to sort out those vibrations before anything else.",905,8,1,1.8k,13d,3.9k,26.2k,159,281,38,1.7k,1,0

Still, VIBE and CLIP data is in the acceptable range… In a way it means that my IMU readings are pretty consistent, would “INS_ACCEL_FILTER” parameter change anything? It is set to 20hz at the moment. Yes, and the compass is also pretty consistent. No idea why would it switch all the time. I will assume it has something to do with the GPS sensor. We have 2 GPS sensors (here and here+), however, I noticed that *.bin file contains only data from one sensor. That seems very odd. And PIDs were tuned having the dummy weight under the copter. It really does not seem to struggle when flying. It seems to have a lot of power, but I will deal with this problem later.

No clue, Msg are consistent with good GPS detection by the board. Some other parameters are missing, like Attitude data relevant to diagnose PID settings. Can you change your LOG_BITMASK value to 63485 or 63486. GPS settings: GPS_AUTO_CONFIG is set to 1 (enable automatic configuration) but GPS_GNSS_MODE (1 and 2) is set to 0 (leave as currently configured). If one GPS config is bad, it could be the cause of missing data. You can force GPS_GNSS_MODE to 67 for both GPS (GPS+GLONASS+SBAS) and report result. At home without flying or arming, just with powering the board, you can verify GPS data in Status screen. ",761,12,0,2.3k,12d,9.5k,60.7k,2,59,10,407,1,0

However, when I arm the Copter it starts logging data and only data from one GPS is in the log. I have HERE and HERE+ GPS devices for redundancy. I see that they both are working and give a similar solution, but I sometimes get the data from one device logged and there is no logged data from the other one. I do not understand the parameter GPS_AUTO_CONFIG fully. Does it bypass the other parameters set for GPS? Does it take into account e.g. GPS_GNSS_MODE parameter that I set if GPS_AUTO_CONFIG is 1. These re the parameters that I changed, but only after changing the LOG_BITMASK it started logging GPS and GPS2 data. Quite unexpected. Still I will confirm on Monday did it really solve the issue. I did notice that sometimes it logs data from both gps and gps2, but quite rarely.

Thanks!","Hello Luka, So it looks like your a 6S copter with 380 KV engines and 16"" props, this coax setup is on the edge of rotor vortex ring state. The Diameter I spoke of is motor to motor dimensions, meaning if the arms are short then we have a faster rolling moment on the aircraft. You may want to try going to 17 inch props and see if it fixes the issue, or up the KV to over 400. There are kind of two problems here, Frame engine to engine diameter or rotor ring state. Rotor ring state will effect every flight mode you have. 3 things need to happen to get into rotor ring state, 1: aircraft descending (falling into its own rotor wash) 2: directional speed of less than 3 Kph (basically in a hover or having wind keep the rotor wash with the aircraft. 3: engines are delivering over 20% power. If those three things all happen at the same time then the propeller on the engine will stall even though it is spinning at the speed it should. Settling with power (rotor ring state) becomes more prevalent on aircraft under load, or larger aircraft. The smaller light aircraft with faster spinning motors usually avoid these situations. The motor to motor diameter cold also be an issue, you have strong engines with a short arm length then you can get out of the range of what the PID’s can handle.",1294,21,0,168,10h,187,2.2k,0,2,3,21,1,0

Thanks!","Hello Lawrence, Thank you for the comment, I did some reading and watching today. I assume you are 100% right that this setup has some potential to get into the rotor ring state - I prefer the copters with larger arms, definitely. However, I am pretty sure that this specific crash did not happen due the rotor ring state. From what I have seen, rotor ring state causes wobble and more or less regular descent and ground impact due to propellers stalling. In this specific case I am pretty sure propellers did not stall. The copter had enough thrust and fell due to large angles of the oscillations. While transitioning from one maximum to the other the copter did not lose height while in the horizontal attitude state, but only when the tilt was almost vertical. That is why I think it did not cause the crash. Nevertheless, this is a big and scary issue and problem that should not be ignored. And dealing with it includes some large changes in my usual flight planing!",972,22,0,386,2d,961,9.8k,10,8,4,36,0.6667,0

Thank You! *","Yes, Slew rate were earlier deemed at too dirty solution, but may spawn in master, making all Solo’s happy. * : RCIN is RCIN , for example, RCIN 3 is throttle input, while RCOUT 3 is output to one of the ESC’s , you can 't compare those like that. The explanation requires some electronics talk, Ill try to make it short; The Solo ESC MCU works on 5v , the solo Cube 2.0 provides 3v3 signals , which is fine, as long too big load does not cause the ESC’s ground potential to go up due to internal resistance in the GND plane/wires. Once it does, the ESC fails to “see” the high periods of the PWM as “high” , and thinks it lost signal, - it stops , then the current drops, and it sees high throttle demand, but refuses to start on high throttle (safety feature) 3DR solved it by adding a throttle slew rate, limiting current spikes. This code is needed in order to fly a 3DR solo reliably , once you have a cube mod, a upgraded firmware, or new cube(kind of extreme solution) , the  Solo is very reliable. I recommend OpenSolo & Solex , a great combination.   ArduCopter once it have slew rate, or stock, 5v modified cube with ArduCopter.",1138,0,0,1.3k,4d,1.4k,8.4k,19,144,106,1.3k,1,0

This might not be true. Is this the upgrade you are referring to:   Low battery thrust priority:  If the battery is getting dangerously low, it will allow itself to sacrifice yaw (rotation) control to increase thrust to prevent a crash.

The drone rolls right and pitches up, even as motor 4 throttle is increased to compensate. It’s impossible to know exactly why motor 4 failed from the logs, but I noticed that the drone was flying at maximum performance for certain sections of the flight. It looks like it must have been a very windy day, as the drone was unable to reach its speed target when flying northwards while at full throttle, and had some difficulty maintaining attitude. Meanwhile, it flew nicely at ~35% throttle on the southward transects. It crashed on a northward transect, so I suspect an ESC or motor might have overheated from flying at full power for an extended time.

It corroborates what a number of other analyses found in the 3DRPilots thread, and even helped narrow it down to one arm of the quadcopter. I’m not sure if you had the opportunity to look at the older logs as well to see if perhaps there were any signs that this was a combination of mechanical+electrical failure? Possibly a motor wearing out? The auto-analysis showed decent motor balance flight to flight, so I never replaced the motors/bearings. In terms of the Solo hardware, it was seemingly likely the ESC fault where ground bounce/lift happens due to the Black Cube signaling at 3.3V and effectively browning out under load, which is what the Slew Rate Code from 3DR attempted to “fix”. It apparently was always possible to trigger this failure by harsh flying conditions, which I likely encountered as it was windy, hot, and higher elevation than normal for me.

In the second you can see the motors working harder and harder, in turn, trying to level the craft.

It is still a bit unclear to me… Do you say that the copter is overpovered in terms of the lift that motors produce in comarison to its weight, or simply that PID parameters are ‘overpowered’ in comparison to the copter weight? I’m just trying to figure out how to make this never happen again. With tuning the PID parameters or adding some weight to the copter, or any of it would solve the problem. Another question is is autotune better than manual PID tuning? Our PID parameters are manually tuned, however we did not tune it but the copter anufacturer tuned them. RATE_RLL_FILT_HZ and RATE_PIT_FILT_HZ (ATC_RAT_RLL_FILT and  ATC_RAT_PIT_FILT) are set to 20Hz, contrary to the 10Hz that are recommended in the Autotune WIKI.

However, after I had all these glitches, I thought the reason is the cable length. So I cut the cable to about 30 cm and tried again. But the GPS still glitches like crazy (*) I attached some log-screenshots of a testflight, and also the log itself. Any help or hint would be greatly appreciated…!

I’m new to log world and would like to know if there is some logical explanation in autotune logs to use this info to manually tune PID’s. I’m trying to do this because autotune won’t save my autotuned pid’s after disarming. It may be caused because my aircraft somehow disarms itself when landed in althold mode.

You should be able to just stick with the defaults and it will be fine. In loiter mode the pilot commands are not as crisp as in stabilize mode.  That’s just the way it is for now and no amount of tuning will change that I’m afraid. I’ve had a look at your logs and there are clearly some oscillations in the roll but it’s not caused by the loiter controller.  I.e. the desired roll from the loiter controller is not oscillating.  This means that the problem is more likely in the Rate Roll.  Your current Rate Roll PIDs don’t look too bad and it’s hard for me to say whether they should be higher or lower.  I’d recommend tuning the Rate Roll P with the CH6 tuning knob or give autotune a try. I’m afraid that that Tuning wiki page is very out of date.

I didn’t see that this would hold me back from a short hover to test inputs. In any case,  I think the problem may have been down to a dodgy connection on the receiver.

On closer inspection the power lead in the servo wire is broken and needs a wiggle to correct.

They were too “hot” for helicopters for the velocity request. I have a PR I am going to send up shortly to fix that for TradHeli. But I don’t know if this is your problem with the Reaper500 or not. Perhaps * can help out here as he has some experience with these. For heli, the velocity xy P gain was 2 and the I-gain was 1, D gain .5. I had to turn the D-gain completely off, and cut both the other values in half. This sets the PSC back to what it was in Copter3.5. And it took care of the problem for heli. I first found the problem with my turbine helicopter (quite big machine running 1,730 rpm headspeed). Was able to duplicate it with my gassers with the governor turned up. Like my Raptor 716 gasser was fine with the defaults at 1,700 rpm. Switch to Idle2 @ 2,300 rpm in Loiter and it became COMPLETELY uncontrollable. Switching to Acro or Stabilize straightens it right out. What confuses me about your PSC settings is that * who is the designer of New Loiter recommends setting the velocity I to half of velocity P.

Leonard moved it to the params and it was assigned a default value of 0.5 in Copter 3.6. So I would set it to zero and see if it stops oscillating.

See the last post","Tried to rebuild a second big quad (a clone of the first, same frame & hw), flashed a brand new pix2.1 w/ 3.5.7. Could have a flight without EKF errors, though there’s something weird about PID (though could be normal, since they are still to be tuned): [P rate and stab are the same for PITCH and ROLL] when i mildly push rolling or pitching (similar to what autotune does) it seems ok, with great stability sharpness and no oscillations but when i push a little bit more, it suddenly goes wobbling to an unrecoverable point, and wobbles more and more until i let sit down on ground lowering throttle. Note that wobble axis is arm-wise, not aligned to pitch or roll, rather 45° to them! Also, it seemed (to my eyes, must verify again) that forward-left motor (motor D or number 3) goes down for an instant when pitching, triggering wobbles, like it’s less powered than the right one. I’ve done ESC calibration procedure and gear (motors, escs) is brand new. Now, i’m doing some other tests: I’ve suspect big one’s ESC are involved or raise some problems which small one doesn’t have or can “absorb” maybe because they’re faster or have newer firmware/design. Big escs are tmotors 80A which are out since 5 years. Smaller are Hobbywing Xrotors 40A, much more recent product. So, i’m putting the Xrotors (a brand new set) into big one, later today will have a flight with them.

See the last post","So, here we are. I fixed the issue. I must admit i’m not exaclty aware what was causing problems yet but for sure i had the following problems:   Rebuilt frame from scratch: with the same configuration and params, the newer one felt much more “stable” meaning EKF would blow lesser. Old frame had some electrical issues, for sure. Maybe a wrong ground plane which interferes with PWMs. Maybe a faulty PDB. I could not figure out thus where/what.   ESCs: first, i lowered ends from 978-20some to 1020-1980us and redone the calibration manually (not with the MP/FC procedure but connecting a simple rx to escs with a ch1-4 outputting the same as throttle, calibrated to same lowered levels above: it changed from night and day, but still some issues remained. EKF not blowing but very close. Quad recovered from mild manouvers but cannot (wobbled HARD motor-wise) when played a little harder.   Then changed the old Tmotor with newer Xrotors. Again, night & day. Now i can play as hard as i could, no problem, no wobbles, no EKF, no Vibe, nothing but a sharp quad under control, even with costant full-stick manouvers. Perfect!  GPS unit: i have the HERE (v1). I read about faulty HW design (compass sensors missing, wrong direction, wrong power supply). I have the MAG4 populated only version. Put a 1K resistor as advised here: https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/issues/6633 As it would fix the power supply issue. Then did a proper Mag calibration, outdoor, with no keys and cell phone in my pockets. It went ok at second attemp. Offsets seems ok. Loiter Ok. Auto missions OK.  It took a month of hard work and lost 10 yrs of my life  but i’ve earned a lot of experience on tuning and finding out HW problems.

On the first flight the multicopter performed takeoff in AltHold mode and, once it reached a safe altitude, I changed it to Position mode. At this point I noticed the first odd thing with the multicopter starting to oscillate severely. As a corrective measure I changed the mode to Stabilize and the copter climbed 10m to 20m above ground. This resulted from the fact that the RC channel for the throttle was in the mid position (to have 0 vertical velocity) and then, when the mode was changed, this value was used as a thrust reference instead of a vertical velocity. Then, I safely landed the copter. With this type of response I have identified that clearly something was wrong with the position control, so I performed a second flight only in Stabilized mode to assess if the attitude control was well tuned. On this second flight, once the copter was in hover position it started to show some oscillation. I also noticed that the attitude response was sluggish. Hence, I started to lower the copter altitude to land it. Almost instantly as I reduced the throttle the oscillations started again and as I reduced the throttle they worsen until the point the copter performed a flip and crashed into the ground. After reviewing the flight logs I saw that the rate control wasn’t as sharp as I would think, but at this point I can’t find the origin of this effect. Regarding the sensors vibrations, everything looked well behaved and well within the values recommended (below 20dB) As someone worked with this platform before? Which gains should I use?

Instead of drawing about 90 amps at full throttle, it was drawing 20 amps. So I thought it might be due to the ESC’s being miscalibrated.  Once I did an all-in-one ESC calibration, I began noticing the yaw rotation. And here’s where it gets interesting.  After the calibration, it then draws 50 amps at full throttle.  That’s a drastic improvement, but it’s still not the 90 amps I’d expect.  But also remember that only every other motor gets warm – the CCW ones. It’s almost like one or two motors still aren’t calibrated, which is introducing rotation into the copter’s thrust.  Then the motors that would need to counter that thrust all work extra hard to stop the rotation.  I could see the mixer slowing-down half the motors to stop the yaw, which would explain why I only see about a 50% current draw at full throttle. The other theory you’ve touched on.  Maybe the compass went bad.  I may just try another compass with it and see if that helps.  I wish someone would look at my logs and see if the compass looks unusually noisy or otherwise “off”. Also, I know there is a motor test in CLI mode.  But is there a test where I could run-up each motor individually and look at the current output?  What would be great is to fixture the copter, then run each motor separately at 0, 25%, 50% and 100% throttle, just to see how much current it’s using.

I waited forever for help and finally figured-out my problem.  It’s gratifying to see any sort of qualified response, which your ideas clearly fit. As to eating your hat, it’s going to be a close call.  My motors were mounted on carbon fiber tubes, but the mounts were drilled – not clamped.  As it turns out, the holes that mounted to the body of the copter and the holes mounted to the engine mounts were all systematically about 1-2 degrees off – barely perceptible to the naked eye.  I put a couple of pieces of electrical tape underneath the motor mounts on one side of most motors, and it trued them right up.  Instead of having 300+ msec differentials in motor pulse width between the CCW and CW motors, the gap is now closer to 50-100 msec. Again, I thank you for your input.

At that moment the drone is oscillating in low frequency. At first glance it seemed to be a issue with barometer as the drone brakes and creates an “pressure pocket” under the drone. However there was not any sudden air pressure changes that could cause this 5 Hz oscillation. If I tried to raise D gain on roll/pitch rate controllers and the drone started to oscillate in high frequency while landing and occasionally while normally flying. So this is not an option to smooth the oscillation caused by P term. I term doesn’t play meaningful part in this case, as it is very smooth and reacts to long term errors. I think that there is only three things that play part at this oscillation. However I cannot find witch is the problem.  One of the several PID’s P term is too high, however if rate controller P term is lowered the stability in wind/gusts is lost. One the sensors / sensor fusions is giving incorrect information and that causes large errors and thus HIGH P term value. IMU vibrations?  I’m open to all suggestions.

As you push for speed, the angle increases until the copter is using all it’s power to increase speed but suddenly notices it is losing altitude, so what can it do? It can’t increase power any more so it has to back the angle off.

Arducopter’s final PWM output is a range between MOT_PWM_MIN and MOT_PWM_MAX. This range doesn’t have to match the RC input, although it should if you calibrated your ESC’s with your transmitter.   The ESC receives PWM from the flight controller. The ESC’s are calibrated to expect some range of PWM, and it should match the MOT_PWM range.

In your case you were in a spiral where the copter was spinning around in a circle.  Not good.  I would check the motors and motor direction.  You may have the motors in the wrong order or spinning in the wrong direction. Use Mission planner and the motor test screen and check that the motors spin in order. Stabilize is the best mode to test that the copter will function correctly.  Loiter is an assisted mode and will try to fly itself assuming that the hardware is functioning correctly.

Sounds like the consensus is: always start in stabilize on a new build. *, Updated title; you are right, it was spiraling/yawing rapidly, not toilet bowling. I feel a bit dumb; this isn’t my first AC rodeo (maybe my 5th pixhawk setup now?). I’ve found loiter to be my favorite mode for tweaking thinks/checking telemetry (for errors/etc), so I mistakenly figured I would just start there. I even re-read the first flight docs prior to this flight, but mistook that for people who are doing their first flight with AC, not necessarily their first flight with a new build. My mistake. I am going to triple check the motor order and motor+prop direction to verify those were all setup correctly. Would love input on what others think about the compass interference.

If your using any after market arms, or motor mounts, be sure to closely monitor the degree of tilt in each motor mount.  If your still using stock motors and mounts, be sure to check the vibrational bushings, if the blow out, which they will, then it can effect your bird. Secondly, you should remove your props and perform an all in one ESC calibration, this will ensure that your ESC are mapped to the exact Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) values that your Remotes controls throttle (RC3) is putting out. Check your GPS_NAVFILTER parameter also, and make sure that it’s set to the default value. When performing you magnetometer (Compass) calibration, make sure that your using the strictest setting that your Compass in both the Pixhawk and your external GPS puck can handle.  Also, don’t introduce more metal to the bird after performing this calibration. Lastly,  I️ can almost guarantee you that you need to do an all in one ESC calibration, just search Pixhawk all in one calibration on YouTube.  If that doesn’t work then pay close attention to motor mount orientation. if this stuff doesn’t work, then hit me up again and I will give you some more stuff the try.",1224,299,0,91,9h,91,997,7,3,3,13,1,0

Could the compass issues raised by the analysis be the problem here? *","That may or may not make any difference. Multi-pathing of GPS signals is the most common reason for “glitches”, and that can happen at any time where terrain or objects can reflect GPS signals, the receiver picks up the signal, but the time stamp is off. It is for this reason that GPS glitches will normally happen closer to the ground, or around objects that can reflect the GPS signal and cause it to multi-path. They rarely happen in flight where the receiver has a good clear view of the GPS satellite constellation and it is more difficult to pick up reflected signals from ground-based objects. My recommendation has always been that the ArduPilot system is definitely capable of fully autonomous takeoffs and landings, but the GPS reliability can cause a crash. And there’s nothing that can be done about that. If you are flying in an area where the GPS reliability is good, it will likely work time after time. But if you don’t want to risk it you always have the option of taking off and landing manually, and starting and ending your auto flights with the aircraft airborne. If you, for instance, use a RTL command to bring it home, as soon as it reaches the hover point and does it’s slight delay before beginning descent to landing, switch to a non-GPS mode (I prefer to use Stabilize) and land the aircraft manually from that point. Long ago I experienced the same thing you just had happen. And have since used the manual method of takeoff and landing to make sure the aircraft is “in the clear” before letting it fly auto. And have never had an issue in hundreds of auto flights with a GPS glitch causing a runaway helicopter. But I remember at least a dozen times in all those flights when the ground station announced a GPS glitch during landing, which did not affect it because I was in a non-GPS flight mode.

The GPS Glitch seemed to be caused by a variance between the “GPS” and “POS” positions. (As seen plotted on the map while viewing the log in Mission Planner.) That variance disappeared very suddenly at the same time as the “EKF primary changed” message appeared, which we assume means that switching to a different IMU fixed the incorrect position reading. Our guess is that the EKF position was incorrect (as a result of an IMU problem) while the GPS position was correct. At this point, the drone was still on the near side of the river, although not where it should have been. However, it suddenly started going across the river while still apparently in Land mode.  The altitude readings in the log show that the drone was indeed descending (as was appropriate for Land mode) while crossing the river. What we don’t understand is why it wasn’t staying in the same spot while doing so. Could this be related to the fact that the drone was flying on its side? The log analysis shows the following. Could the compass issues raised by the analysis be the problem here? *","Yep. I didn’t have anybody to hold the phone camera when I was doing this, so people could see what I was doing, and had to just set it down. But this is an outline of of my preflight checks for a helicopter before flying an auto mission.

Hardware is Pixfalcon, generic X quad, Holibro PDB. 3 cell 3000mAh or 5200mAh, nominal 11.1v Once battery voltage failsafe is triggered the logged battery voltage varies like crazy. The variations are not present before failsafe, and if I actually change the failsafe threshold the variations only start after FS whatever the voltage level actually is. So I can change the FS voltage 11.0 and the variations will kick in once FS is triggered. Or I can set the FS really low (or to be ignored) and the variations in voltage do not show up at all even right down to dangerously low battery voltages. I’m very sure that the variations are NOT due to the PDB or batteries, since the variations are definitely linked to the FS condition. A regulated powersupply and Fluke 85 meter do not indicate any such actual variations at low “battery” voltages either on the regulated supply 5v DC or on the Vsense wire. I’ve used this bench setup to calibrate the Pixfalcon battery voltage scaling, and compared it closely with the battery alarm measurements too. The pixfalcon internal beeper doesnt seem to interfere either, as mode changes and other noises it makes dont seem to have any effect on the voltage sense, or flight stability. there is also an audible 3 digit voltage alarm on the balance leads - the timing of it’s beeps dont match up with the frequency of vsense fluctuations, and in fact it is set a little more conservative than the AC failsafe voltage, so it usually starts beeping before the failsafe condition is triggered. Attached is a screenshot and log - it’s a small flight started with an almost flat battery in order to demonstrate the issue. In the screenshot you can see the voltage sensed has “normal” variation of about 0.04 volts and also the big variations linked to actual current drain due to flight, but when it hits FS there’s variations of about 0.3 volts not linked to current drain. In the actual log file, the variations after FS are not reflected in current drain. * * (601.8 KB)","Probably should put this thing to bed! I can no longer correlate the variations in Vcc with repeatable events. Maybe it’s because I removed the Pixfalcon power connector and soldered wires direct to the board and added a capacitor across +5v and 0v. Maybe it’s times of the day or phases of the moon… No other wiring changes though. Here’s a graph from today that seems to show Vcc variations only AFTER landing from fail-safe, and not during failsafe or before arming like in previous logs (before I did any wiring changes). Battery voltage and current didnt have any unexpected variations. Conditions were windy. If anyone’s interested enough, I’ll upload the actual log.",673,37,1,1.9k,50d,13.1k,114k,17,790,14,2.8k,1,0

If the variations go away, decide how much you need the LED or buzzer. Even though the variations might not be going low enough to cause a brownout or other issues, it’s probably a sign you’ve got problems with the power connectors, wiring or the power brick/PDB. I’d suggest any strange variations in Vcc should warrant investigation of your power supply and connectors anyway.  NTF_LED_BRIGHT  0=off, 1=low, 2=medium, 3=high NTF_BUZZ_ENABLE  0=disable, 1=enable The Pixfalcon has JST-SH connectors (I think) and they’re very tiny, might be a reliability issue there. I’ve pretty much eliminated the variations by soldering power wiring direct to the Pixfalcon board and adding a polarised cap across the supply. Your own remedy may be much simpler than mine depending on your flight controller and connectors. This pic from earlier in the thread demonstrates the problem, so you don’t have to read all the way through the thread:",1074,38,1,1.9k,50d,13.1k,114k,17,790,14,2.8k,1,0

I notice what looks like 4 separate lost-link events in the C1 and C2 plot. (3 of them recover, of course) I’ve never used Turnigy, but the Futaba RX that I fly have programmable failsafe conditions. In a lost-link case, the receiver commands the pre-set values for all channels. So if your failsafe condition has C1 at 1000 (standard “min” value) and C2 at 2000 (standard “max” value) then lost-link events explain the plot, and possibly the crash. If you haven’t modified your TX and/or RX settings post-crash, you can test this hypothesis. As for what caused the lost-link… I might speculate just for fun. Idea #1: can you view the CURR and/or POWR in the log? Maybe find evidence of a brownout or blackout? ESC# logs might also show if there was some internal power issue? (crazy) Idea #2: You said you impacted a power line? Would a high-current power line be able to interfere with nearby weak radio signals? That might explain the lost-links, but I would expect the radio link to recover as the quad fell away from the lines.

I first changed out all the ESCs, that still didn’t solve the problem, then changed out all 4 motors, and finally, I had a system that was fully compatible with the flight controller.   The cause of this crash was due to a sharp gust of wind that required a very high throttle response to counter, and I later found out that certain ESCs and motors are simply not capable of responding to throttle requests above certain frequencies, so when the hard gust of wind hit the quad, the amount of throttle response required to counter the abrupt attitude change vastly exceeded the frequency the ESCs and motors were capable of responding to, and they stalled out, and it flipped over with no chance of recovering after that point.

Motors 1 & 3 were running wide open and throttling to try to recover it, and it had large deviations in attitude due to not enough power and thrust to keep it stable. As you have probably known, helicopters can handle wind that multi-rotors can’t, and the larger a multi-rotor gets, and the bigger the props, the worse they get in the wind. There is limitations on how fast motors can throttle and change thrust vectors compared to the cyclic response time of helicopters that are capable of extreme 3D flight maneuvers.",620,532,1,1.5k,37d,3.1k,25.8k,24,507,33,2.7k,0.6667,0

I just see the throttle signals going to 100% on the motors trying to stabilize it, and the problem you describe should cause stalling of the motors if you did an abrupt full throttle climb. I just see the Pixhawk sending a 2000 pwm microsecond signal to the ESC’s, which should be in the range that any ESC can handle. From what I can find on those particular ESC’s they have adaptive timing, a reversing feature, frame rate up to 500kHz, and pwm microsecond input range of 1000-2000. I don’t see where the Pixhawk exceeded any of those specs. The reversing feature is similar to Align’s helicopter ESC’s. So I don’t think that should be an issue. Just trying to identify what the specific incompatibility would be with ArduPilot. The Pixhawk’s output looks within specs for them across the board. I think you would have to do a bench test, tie the copter down, and operate it at full throttle under controlled conditions to actually identify a motor stalling problem above a certain throttle pwm range. Otherwise all the indications in the log I looked at show that no motors actually quit. They just ran out of thrust based on the throttle percentages I see vs desired vs actual attitude.

After this crash, I tried to do an Autotune, and the same thing happened, it would do the first roll maneuver, try to counter with an even higher throttle request from the opposing side, and again the motors could not read the high signal and it would flip over.   I then replaced the ESCs with known compatible components, and still the exact same result when attempting an autotune, then I replaced the Align motors, and finally it worked perfectly the first time I attempted an autotune. The Align ESCs cannot be programmed, they’re designed for Align’s flight controller, and the motors are not compatible either, I do think this is a frequency(sync) problem that simply cannot be adjusted.    In short, if you attempt to run a Pixhawk with these stock Align ESCs & motors on an M480L, the result will not be good, it will fly, but will simply not respond to high throttle requests, so is basically a disaster waiting to happen.",1393,533,0,219,1d,211,3.2k,0,5,18,108,0.6667,0

The logs do not indicate that based on the power consumption measured by the power module and calculating the individual throttle percentages. The motors were simply maxed out trying to regain loss of both yaw and roll control. RCOUT.1 was operating at ~90% power consistently before the crash, which also corresponds to the wattage power consumption, calculated from the individual throttle percentages @ the 7m/s ground speed it was traveling at prior to hover. It just flat ran out of thrust on one corner trying to correct 40 degree yaw deviation and 70 degree roll deviation at the same time. According to Align’s specs, the maximum speed for this copter is 15m/s and maximum allowable frame tilt is 30 degrees. It hit way over 30 degrees tilt when the wind hit it. It peaked at 1,375 watts while the Pixhawk was trying to regain control, but the aircraft was simply beyond it’s thrust limit to correct that much deviation from desired attitude and couldn’t recover.

It’s the motors. Three-phase AC permanent magnet motors are nothing special. As long as the speed controller sends them the three-phase AC psuedo sine waves at the correct timing by measuring the back EMF on the inactive phase in the motor, they just run. The interaction between the ESC and motor has nothing to do with the pwm signal sent from the Pixhawk on the throttle line. It just tells the ESC’s microprocessor how fast to trigger the FET’s to run the motor at the right speed, AC frequency, and phase angle. It could be a ESC calibration issue if the ESC can’t read the full 1000 pwm microsecond signal range. But if you replaced the ECS’s and still had the same problem, then it wasn’t ESC cal. It was the motors all along and the Pixhawk has ZERO interaction with the motors.",829,533,0,1.5k,37d,3.1k,25.8k,24,507,33,2.7k,0.6667,0

I replaced the motors with 360kv KDEs which work perfectly, and I still use the stock Align 17"" props, it carries a 2LB camera payload easily, and hovers with it at 50% throttle which is perfect for a quad rotor, so it is neither under-powered or under-proped.

The helicopter ESC’s have low, mid and high settings. The multi-rotor ones are designed to only measure the back EMF on the inactive phase of the motor and use it to determine phase and timing angle for the rpm the motor is running at. The biggest issue with Pixhawk would be not being able to calibrate the throttle, but that doesn’t appear to be the issue based on what I see in your log. The power consumption of the aircraft corresponds nicely with throttle percentages, meaning the ESC’s were responding to the throttle just fine. And in hover the sync of the ESC’s looked pretty good with the throttle percentages per motor nice and even. It only got off when the aircraft started fighting wind. KDE motors are high-end motors, the Aligns are not. Without actually bench testing one of those Align motors you can’t be even be sure their Kv rating is right. They’re not very popular motors in the multi world. And even in the heli world the Align motors are usually the first thing to get replaced with a higher quality Scorpion or xNova because the bearings don’t last, they run hot, and their winding and core loss quality leaves a little to be desired. With the KDE’s you can be pretty sure that if it’s rated at 550 watts the motor will actually deliver. That might be a calculated, inflated spec for the Align’s. These brushless motors are nothing special. But there is huge quality differences between the different brands, in the iron losses in the core, what magnets are used, and winding quality. That’s why a 700-class Scorpion costs $300 and an Align only costs $169. Basically, Align is a vacuum cleaner company that builds RC aircraft as a sideline**. I think their multi-rotor aircraft are designed to compete in the market at a price point. And while it may be a very nice aircraft I can’t believe the drives they use on it are any better than their helicopter drives.  Which are grossly over-rated to the point where they are using 700-class motors in 550-size helicopters. You can pull the 700-class drive out and put in a 600-class Scorpion drive and get better power and performance on less amps. I honestly think the whole problem was under-performing motors right from the start. **Kind of a joke - on HeliFreak the common thing is that most people say Align’s vacuum cleaners really suck. And so do their helicopters.  LOL! But, honestly, I’ve found their helicopters to be not too bad for hobby-grade stuff.",2478,533,0,1.5k,37d,3.1k,25.8k,24,507,33,2.7k,0.6667,0

The only way I have to switch from one to another currently is to quickly cycle between a few modes, (i.e. if I’m currently at mode 1 and I want to get to mode 3 I switch through mode 2 quickly as I move the 3 position switch from pos 1 to pos 3.

It is quite apparent the operator was not paying attention to flight modes or errors that the app was telling them about.  There has to be at least 20 failed mode changes in there, which the operator just wildly pushing buttons and not noticing what is going on. This always overrode the failsafes on numerous occasions.  This went on for literally 10 minutes before it crashed.  What GPS in in this Solo? It’s obviously not the stock GPS since it has 18-19 sats and a 0.6 HDOP.

The vibration is nasty and can easily have caused this flyaway.I always use Zeal gel for mounting mine.Probably should be your first move.It’s the Z axis that shows problems.(That’s the uppydowny bit in technical terms). The barometer worked perfectly but the vibes can shake the life out of the accelerometers and therefore produce some pretty wacky commands or lack of command.So stop trying to find a workaround to this particular flight and try to get the set up better next time out.Vibe reduction is always number one (vibes under 30 in the 3.3 log with no clipping ).Zeal gel or similar usually works.That is the place to start. Any reason for not having a GPS ? It gives far more capability like returning to launch in the case of certain hardware failures.It wouldn’t have helped here mind. I’m not sure tht anything you did would have helped in this instance.The flight controller was being beaten to death by the vibes at the time and may have not been in a very good listening mood.Stabilize and zero throttle should have brought it down.Dropping the throttle in ALT_HOLD or LAND will bring it down slow.You didn’t have it in STABILIZE long enough to ditch it this way.Remember that next flight.Stabilize tis the mode that puts you in control.All the others rely on various flight controller input and if it’s shaking to death at the time… It does get the adrenalin going when it stops doing what you want it to do.

There is something not right there and I would start looking at Props, motor twist or frame twist, something mechanical. This is assuming that ESC are calibrated right and other electrical issues accounted for, e.g., same motors, same age, bearings good, etc. The need for stability in this case will be overriding flight direction commands, so I would look at fixing this first and see how it flies then.

656,122,Strange Pitch-axis Oscillation,15,2188,1,"Hi all, I’ve been chasing a weird oscillation problem for close to a year now. It isn’t visible by line-of-sight, but makes FPV really unpleasant. The oscillation is in the pitch-axis, and appears whenever there is horizontal motion. I’ve exhausted the obvious (to me) possibilities, like motor/prop vibration, PID tuning, flight mode, airframe resonances, damped mass (gimbal) resonances, bad hardware, and video sync. The aircraft has evolved considerably since I first noticed the issue, but the problem persists. The only parts that I haven’t changed are the FC vibration damping, and the motors/ESCs. The vibration damping just occurred to me today, so that will be my next test. So I’m now forced to consider some possibilities that I hadn’t before, or didn’t want to. I may have to replace the ESCs and motors. I really want to be able to use the set that I have. They are KDE products and set me back quite a bit. The possibility that I want to ask the forum about is whether or not there are any FC parameter changes that might help. I’m using a 3DR Pixhawk, Rev2.1, and Copter 3.4.6. I’ve included a link to a goggle DVR recording and a recent dataflash log. I would be most grateful if there is someone out there who can look over the log for anything unusual. I’ve spent some time checking it out, but I’m not expert enough to spot a problem. One thing that you might notice is that my STAB gains are pretty high. I don’t know why it tunes this way, but I do know that I can reduce the STAB_P gain until the aircraft is extremely mushy and the problem persists. The aircraft is a TBS Disco Pro, with 5200mAh/4s, KDE 20A ESCs, KDE XF2315-885kV motors, minimOSD, ImmersionRC 600mW/5.8GHz VTX, DragonLink Micro RX, 3DR GPS/Compass, my own barometer mod (tried that too), Runcam Swift FPV cam. *  * ","I would be looking first at your frame and camera mounts before the motors and esc’s.

Yeah, it looks like a mechanical issue, but as far as I can tell I’ve eliminated all mechanical sources. If it is only happening in forward flight, is it proportional to speed? - The oscillation happens in horizontal flight, but is most obvious in forward flight. How flexible are your props? - The current props are quite flexible. However I’ve also been using very rigid props. No difference in behavior. Is Graupner 10x4 C-Prop. Was APC MR 10x4.5. How flexible are the arms? - The arms are slightly flexible. They are the standard glass-reinforced resin F450 arms. However I have also used very rigid carbon fiber arms. No change. FYI - I’ve even changed the frame plates. Was carbon fiber. Is G10-FR4. Are the camera mounts solid or is there slop? - The camera is a typical mini FPV cam, mounted on the bracket supplied with it. Again, fairly rigid, but not perfect. Also, In the flights recorded in the linked files, the camera gimbal is disabled and fixed with electrical tape to prevent the damped mass from interacting with the FC control loops. I’ve linked a couple of images of the aircraft for reference. Cheers! Chris",1164,0,1,25,5h,28,143,0,1,8,41,0.3333,0

The tube into the front of the Pixhawk is for an external static pressure port. This is the funky disk sticking out of the top. I hadn’t thought of that as a possible means of coupling vibration into the IMU. I’ll try a test flight with the tube disconnected. I have looked at the bundled ESC wires as a cause. I removed the cable ties and let the wires hang out with only enough constraint to keep them from contacting the props. I didn’t observe any improvement, but maybe there is more that I can do here. I hadn’t thought of mounting the camera facing backward. Interesting idea. I’m certainly willing to give it a go. The external static pressure port, in theory, makes a cover over the Pixhawk redundant. However, I guess I can’t rule out the possibility that there is still an issue there. I wish I could glean more from the dataflash logs. I can’t tell by looking at the baro measurement if the behavior is normal or not. But then it doesn’t look like the granularity is fine enough to pick up something in the neighborhood of a 5-10Hz oscillation. And my effort to change the flight controller vibration damping didn’t yield anything. I tried both changing the damping balls from 50g to 200g and also tried taping the FC to the top plate while still on the damping mount. No improvement. I don’t want to strap the FC directly to the top plate due to a history of vibration-induced fly-aways. Thanks for the suggestions!",1471,1,0,25,5h,28,143,0,1,8,41,0.6667,0

It did bring the measurable vibration levels down as expected, but it actually induced some resonance related vibration peaks at certain frequencies - and the actual flight behaviour was far from good. autotune led to less than desirable results. I was getting pretty frustrated and then decided to give it a “last try” by ripping out the anti-vibration mount and fixing the FC directly to the CfK using 4 1cm^2 pads of 3M VHB tape. And guess what - the result was amazing - autotune produces really good results all of a sudden and the stability of the copter is  much better, on a calm day it hardly moves in any direction, no twitching, no vibrating. As part process I realized that my vibrations actually were caused by the screws not being tightened enough and thus giving the whole frame some flex. I had experimented with aluminium screws but it didn’t work out, I was not able to tighten them enough to eliminate the frame flex. Now I am using steel screws tightened to 0,6Nm using a torque-wrench and it is all pretty solid. And I mounted a cover over the FC like this * I screwed it on with ~12  screws - and i think by doing so further stabilized the overall structure and reduced flex further. So for me, I got rid of the vibrations using better screws with significant torque, a stabilizing “hood” and by removing the anti-vibration mount.

I’ll be brave and try attaching the FC directly to the top frame plate. I’m nervous about the idea. I’ve had fly-aways with other Pixhawk aircraft due to vibe issues that I couldn’t overcome with prop/motor balancing. That was why I originally bought the KDE motors. I was tired of screwing around with vibration issues. I was chasing a persistent jello problem when the oscillation showed up. The screws supplied with the Disco Pro kit do leave something to be desired. The heads are really sloppy. The socket caps are both too large and have a wide tolerance. About half of them slip on my hex drivers, any of them, and can’t really be torqued down. However, they do provide many spares. I’ll go through them and pick out those that fit snugly and see if I can improve the frame rigidity. Cheers,",839,1,0,25,5h,28,143,0,1,8,41,0,0

It’s hard to see from the pics, but it appears the arms are only fixed with two screws at the very tip? That might not be the most robust way to attach them? Just for comparison, in my case, I have the arms reach into the main frame by ~5cm and have them fixed with 4 screws each arm. I can take the whole copter at two opposite arms and try to “bend” it like you would try to bend a rod, it does not bend more than maybe 1mm - at a length from tip to tip of about 80cm.

Sorry that I didn’t see your message before now. I’m no longer receiving email notifications. I appreciate your participation in brainstorming, or drizzling in my case. I’ve spent a fair amount of time asking that question “What has not changed?” I’m really narrowing it down now. Motors and ESCs are different. Although it is a different physical unit, it still uses a Pixhawk. I don’t want to abandon Pix/AC, but I have a Naza-M Lite on the way, just to eliminate the possibility. Yeah, this frame is not as stiff as it could be. The arms are each mounted with six screws. All screws have been checked, per your previous advice. I’ll definitely keep the frame idea in mind. Your personal experience with frame flex is a valuable data point. In the Pixhawk vein, there is one possibility that occurred to me just a few minutes before checking this thread. Both of my Pixhawks are modified with an external static pressure port for the barometer. Being modified the way they are, if I haven’t sealed well enough around the baro, I could be getting air gusts coming in through the microSD opening. At one point I had tape over the opening to improve the FC’s resistance to the elements. I removed the tape at a time when I was pulling the uSD card often to copy logs. It’s a long shot, but possible. I put some tape over the opening. I haven’t seen any obvious signs of a problem in any baro readings, but the granularity of the log is pretty large. For the moment I have an unflyable quad, due to a different issue. I need to get that worked out before I go back to 3.4.6 or 3.5. It’s been a long and expensive ordeal. When I get the mystery solved, I’ll get two things out of it: the opportunity to laugh at myself, and parts enough to build two complete Discos.",1793,9,0,25,5h,28,143,0,1,8,41,1,0
668,122,Strange Pitch-axis Oscillation,15,2188,13,"Hi all, I’ve been chasing a weird oscillation problem for close to a year now. It isn’t visible by line-of-sight, but makes FPV really unpleasant. The oscillation is in the pitch-axis, and appears whenever there is horizontal motion. I’ve exhausted the obvious (to me) possibilities, like motor/prop vibration, PID tuning, flight mode, airframe resonances, damped mass (gimbal) resonances, bad hardware, and video sync. The aircraft has evolved considerably since I first noticed the issue, but the problem persists. The only parts that I haven’t changed are the FC vibration damping, and the motors/ESCs. The vibration damping just occurred to me today, so that will be my next test. So I’m now forced to consider some possibilities that I hadn’t before, or didn’t want to. I may have to replace the ESCs and motors. I really want to be able to use the set that I have. They are KDE products and set me back quite a bit. The possibility that I want to ask the forum about is whether or not there are any FC parameter changes that might help. I’m using a 3DR Pixhawk, Rev2.1, and Copter 3.4.6. I’ve included a link to a goggle DVR recording and a recent dataflash log. I would be most grateful if there is someone out there who can look over the log for anything unusual. I’ve spent some time checking it out, but I’m not expert enough to spot a problem. One thing that you might notice is that my STAB gains are pretty high.

It was the tape. After a year of screwing around with weird, jerky flight behavior, it was the tape. Here’s what I think happened. There has always been a leak in my external static pressure port. The tape masked the problem by blocking airflow into the uSD slot. When I removed the tape, I exposed the problem. The confusing part is that I tested in Stabilize mode. I didn’t think that Stabilize depends on the barometer for attitude control. Thanks to Mike and Chris for your input. Your time and Ideas are greatly appreciated.",546,10,0,25,5h,28,143,0,1,8,41,1,1

Is it possible that the compasses were not working at all? I did not set up the battery monitor yet, so that’s ok. Will do that before the next flight. Thanks for pointing that out! I believed that due to the cube (with the compasses) being on top of the mounting plate, it’s far enough from the ESCs. Seems like I was wrong. I like the placement of the ESCs though because it reduces the mess on the top plate. Would a motor/compass calibration help or should I just rely on the external compass on the M8N? I also considered adding another M8N for GPS redundancy, that way I’d have a second external compass. That’s the CoG issue that I suspected. I added a gimbal in front and shifted the battery further back. In this flight, I was using a 6Ah battery instead of a 10Ah one.

Right after the copter Yawed about 180 degrees I see the motors start to change.  They were fighting a Yaw which maybe caused by a motor starting to fail. When a motor fails on an OCTA quad the quad starts to spin out of control since it is no longer able to keep it’s yaw.

739,146,"Crash help, copter loss of altitude",3,855,1,"Hello, recently had to pull the chute on my copter towards the end of an auto mission. It was at the penultimate waypoint, when it reached the waypoint it stopped and lost altitude. The day was windy so there had been altitude deviations several times during the mission and I had attributed this to the wind affecting the barometer. However this time it descended and continued to loose altitude by over 5m. I suspected something was wrong and entered loiter to end the mission and take control. Raised the throttle and tried to regain control. The copter did not respond and maintain altitude and the deceleration accelerated. At this point it was ~35m high and I had two choices, to try althold or manual or to trigger the parachute (a recent addition). My initial reaction was that it was acting like it was low on power, potentially battery issues? And so I took the decision to try the chute as if it is battery issues manual would help regain control. Pulled chute, it fired, canopy fully formed ~ 15/20 meters and slowed decent to a point where it limited  damage to fractured carbon on the landing gear and a small bend in one of the arm mounts. I think I heard a motor stall at the point where it lost control. Also the copter was loosing altitude whilst maintaining level so I think think fc was maintaining stability whilst insufficient lift was available… could this point towards a motor or esc issue and thus the loss of this meant the fc has to reduce power on opposite motor and thus insufficient lift? Immediately after pulling the chute I checked telemetry and voltage seemed to be good. Upon reaching the copter I made it safe and then looked for any initial signs. All motors and escs were cool. Battery voltages good. (2 6s lipos) and no visible cause for the in flight issue. I am not experienced in reviewing logs, but I have tried to have a look at the logs. What I have noticed is: that the UAV is slightly underpowered, it would appear average throttle during flight is ~60 %. Battery voltages seemed ok I think there may be an esc calib issue. Towards the end of the flight the fc was asking ch2 for more and more thrust, reaching 100pc several times and then reaching 100pc and staying at the point where the issue occurred. I cant figure out a route cause for the loss of altitude. I am experienced at building, but there is always more to learn and I learn things every day. Especially with apm!

Ensure you have the pixhawk on soft mounts and do not have stiff or tight cables or anything else that could be transferring vibration into the pixhawk.   Test GPS aiding without optical flow and optical flow aiding without GPS first and get both working reliably before trying to combine them.   Make sure you have focussed the sensor and for the best position hold use the flow sensor binary as recommended in the wiki *   Do your initial optical flow testing over a level surface initially and ensure that you can get a solid position hold without GPS first   Tuning the EKF is best done by logging replay data and tuning offline using the EKF replay *. It can be done by successive trial and error tests, but this is normally a slow and frustrating process due to the stochastic nature of the errors.

760,155,"Odd crashes when mavproxy/dronekit connected, 3.5-dev",1,865,1,"Hi, I tested some mavlink precision landing code in SITL which seemed OK so I went and tried a couple of flights.  I did some flights and landing first normally without the OBC connected and all was well, so then I connected the OBC.  Whenever the OBC (mavproxy+dronekit script sending landing_target and distance_sensor messages) was connected it would experience large random twitches followed by inverted nosedive into the hedge. I’ve attached one log as an example.  In this log I do a couple of test flights and landings first without OBC, then connect the OBC.  At 19115 I ask it to land which it starts and then shortly goes bananas - twitches then turns over and dives into the hedge.  By 20310 it’s all gone pear shaped.  I notice in the logs there are quite a few gaps after PL messages eg. 20425 and then there’s an EKF anomaly and unexpected event 62, whatever that is.  Note that CTUN.alt carries down into negative territory even though it was sitting in a hedge at that point.  It looks like there are lots of EKF innovations in the latter part of the log, but I don’t know if these are really abnormal or not. I don’t believe the dronekit script was actually sending any messages at all during this period, but I’m adding more debug output and will try to replicate this again tomorrow. * (723.7 KB)","Hmm, please (continue to) ignore this for now, I think this was either caused by sending dud mavlink messages or by massive EMI that is interfering with various hardware components.",181,3,0,1.1k,6d,2.1k,16.1k,41,231,17,543,0.6667,0

It requires constant input on my part to keep it from hitting something really hard. It will roll all of the sudden at almost a 45 degree angle. I changed motors to a 4114 330 kv motor with a built in folding prop adapter and am running 15x5.2 props. I have checked balance on them and CG on the props. Everything was good there. Flight controller is mounted on an anti vibration platform. the one with the 4 little silicon things that go into the base plate at an angle.I am running 30a opto afro esc flashed with blheli. I have turned up demag compensation as well as motor timing to medium high. I will include my lastest log file. I am running on 6s Quad copters center of gravity is right in the middle. I am starting to think I got the wrong motors. Maybe I should return them and get a fixed prop kind…i dont know they are the only thing I can think of that could be causing an issue. I included two seperate log files. The vibes look odd to me between the two. Any help is great I have been working on this thing for so long. I ended up switchin flight controller to the pixhawk because the librepilot revolution was giving me GPS fits. I had the quad flying fairly well with my old motors which were a 2216 rewound to around 400kv running on 6s. I had a flyaway and it ran into a tree and damaged a motor. So I figured it was a good time to get new motors. * (281.7 KB) * (740.0 KB),Here is another one in which the vibrations are strange. On the graph you can see them get really small. That is when my quad is at minimum 4 feet off the ground. I will say this and I am not sure if it make a difference or not. I have always used carbon fiber props. Not this time I went with a plastic glass or something like that type of prop. They are stiff but still flex.* (953.3 KB),389,0,1,33,7h,77,584,0,6,13,42,0.3333,0

Has anyone ran into problems like this? I’m not certain if its just the clone pixhawk or my code. I might remove some code to see if I can get logging back but I’ve changed logging before with no problem. Any tips would be appreciated. thanks,I figured this one out - turns out when I was flashing the pixhawk - the log_bitmask was getting changed to a funky number. Not sure what caused that but once I set it back to default - logging worked,200,7,0,129,8h,273,2.5k,0,3,14,26,1,1

Initial tests with the GPS set to normal NMEA were fine with position variance less than .5m Currently testing it with SBF enabled and RTK injected GPS corrections using Mission Planner. We immediately had compass problems and after recalibrating several times were able to arm. The copter showed huge compass variance and what I first thought as a fly away each time I switched to Loiter turned out to be very large diameter toilet bowling once I was game enough to let if fly away for a few meters. This is curious as it was flying well before using both the Pixhawk compass and the Septentrio internal compass. I have been trying to analyse the logs but there is just too much wrong for me to digest. Using Dronekit-la I see “Severe scheduler overruns” that I have never seen before. It also reports Compass fails and GPS fails, although our GPS readings were varying by less than 5cm on the GCS.

The copter flyes very well withouth any big problems in the air, also with standard PID very stable and fast in climbing altitude At beginning I had no issues flying with 12"" plastic props, but it was extremely loud like a Hayabusa and the climb rate was low. The payload close to the limit. In first fly attempts no crashes. I decided to go for 13"" folding carbon props and the climb rate was perfect, the power consumption even at full speed within the ESC limits (max around 25A) But I had a lot of issues with the Afros & SimonK. Continuosly out of sync and very fast flip on dead in the AutoTune mode on the axis where motor went out of sync. I could reproduce on ground the issue by putting the throttle from sticks to switches and changing fast from 0 to fullspeed. Had a lot of out of sync and burned 2 ESC. I changed the ESC and one motor and after the advice from Marco I flashed them all with BLHeli. With some setting I kept having out of syncs, with damped light off + medium high timing no problems any more on ground tests with fast throttle changes. I decided to do AutoTune again and first tryed with only one battery withouth payload (tail heavy). Autotune over corn field withouth any issues, I was really happy. I tried today again with 1 batterie + front payload (good center of gravity) over a corn field again. AutoTune startet and at one moment, where I put the pitch stick back to make the copter return, it flipped slowly over one axis and crashed on ground but not like an ESC has gone out of sync. I tried to simulate and could reproduce it again. When I put the pitch + roll stick completely back and left, the copter slowly flipped over motor M2 (Mission Planner motor C) and went down. To me personally it looked more like a wrong PID setting… he is flipping to much than he loses height and fells in the corn field. I tried again putting pitch completely forward + roll to tel left, and it did the same flipcrash over Motor M3 (Mission Planner motor D) So Im wondering what the issue could be and if anyone can understand from the log what happened.

The copter flyes very well withouth any big problems in the air, also with standard PID very stable and fast in climbing altitude At beginning I had no issues flying with 12"" plastic props, but it was extremely loud like a Hayabusa and the climb rate was low. The payload close to the limit. In first fly attempts no crashes. I decided to go for 13"" folding carbon props and the climb rate was perfect, the power consumption even at full speed within the ESC limits (max around 25A) But I had a lot of issues with the Afros & SimonK. Continuosly out of sync and very fast flip on dead in the AutoTune mode on the axis where motor went out of sync. I could reproduce on ground the issue by putting the throttle from sticks to switches and changing fast from 0 to fullspeed. Had a lot of out of sync and burned 2 ESC. I changed the ESC and one motor and after the advice from Marco I flashed them all with BLHeli. With some setting I kept having out of syncs, with damped light off + medium high timing no problems any more on ground tests with fast throttle changes. I decided to do AutoTune again and first tryed with only one battery withouth payload (tail heavy). Autotune over corn field withouth any issues, I was really happy. I tried today again with 1 batterie + front payload (good center of gravity) over a corn field again. AutoTune startet and at one moment, where I put the pitch stick back to make the copter return, it flipped slowly over one axis and crashed on ground but not like an ESC has gone out of sync. I tried to simulate and could reproduce it again. When I put the pitch + roll stick completely back and left, the copter slowly flipped over motor M2 (Mission Planner motor C) and went down. To me personally it looked more like a wrong PID setting… he is flipping to much than he loses height and fells in the corn field. I tried again putting pitch completely forward + roll to tel left, and it did the same flipcrash over Motor M3 (Mission Planner motor D) So Im wondering what the issue could be and if anyone can understand from the log what happened.

By analyzing the log. the crash is very consistent with a desync issue. Could you please share your BLHeli settings with us?

Log Download: * I would really appreciate your help Thank you very much in advance Igor","Just a note about BLHeli and desync problems: they desync as well with certain drive setups, but newer releases of BLHeli kind of hide the desync state. The motor just doesn’t follow the throttle, but without the common sounds of a desync problem or stalling the motor completely. Unfortuantely this behavior makes it very hard to evaluate a certain drive setup, so I discontinued the use of BLHeli ESCs. I guess in flight the very delayed throttle reaction in the desync state is almost as bad as a complete stall, and would be probably enough to explain the loss of attitude control.",585,3,0,455,3d,1.2k,12.1k,0,16,5,46,1,0

This is way below than any reasonable minimum value for LiPo, so the LAND event couldn’t perform as expected because there wasn’t enough power on the battery to fly. Depleting the batteries to such low values increases the risk of a bad accident caused by the LiPo. If you see this graph with Voltage and Current the voltage sags quite heavily as soon as you apply power, so the battery (which wasn’t fully charged to begin with) drops to almost 3.6V per cell.

Drone info: -full carbon fiber body -12-15 Amp motors - All info is Chinese so unfortunately no more info that I could provide -100A Platinum pro ESC’s -2 x 22.2 2600 Mah Lipo’s -Pixhawk FC - connected to power mudule *  3DR GPS/MAG -Jdrones long range radio’s ( telemetry port) - connected to power module # 2 -X8R 2.4 ghz radio (rc) -2 x power modules (http://www.targethobby.com/apm26-28-pixhawk-power-module-v10-output…) (all test flights with RC controller & no payload)) I flew the quad after setting all of the recommended pixhawk parameters and calibrations. I tested some short take off and landings to make sure I could control the quad in Stabilize mode and all seemed ok (RC controller only). I added the Jdrones telemetry radios so I could have more info displayed during my next planned test flight. During this next test flight (stabilize mode)  the drone went into a crazy death wobble and flipped over during take off. Lucky the few second flight was at a low altitude so only the carbon fiber props were damaged and the top cover of the drone. Please note - During this crash I was only using the throttle control to take off. I’m a newbie when it comes to the pixhawk and analyzing the flight data but I noticed the compass info go way off during acceleration of the motors so possibly interference causing the problem?? If this is the case I’m not sure why the first few tests were o.k. This may be some helpful info but after the first test i attempted to re calibrate the compass and had issues with MP freezing during the calibration. Eventually I got it to work but compass # 2 had some large Z vale of -460 but from what I read it uses compass 1. After the crash its now giving a prearm error of inconsistent compasses. The pixhawk also wont always power up with battery power now but after multiple tries it will work. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

Drone info: -full carbon fiber body -12-15 Amp motors - All info is Chinese so unfortunately no more info that I could provide -100A Platinum pro ESC’s -2 x 22.2 2600 Mah Lipo’s -Pixhawk FC - connected to power mudule *  3DR GPS/MAG -Jdrones long range radio’s ( telemetry port) - connected to power module # 2 -X8R 2.4 ghz radio (rc) -2 x power modules (http://www.targethobby.com/apm26-28-pixhawk-power-module-v10-output…) (all test flights with RC controller & no payload)) I flew the quad after setting all of the recommended pixhawk parameters and calibrations. I tested some short take off and landings to make sure I could control the quad in Stabilize mode and all seemed ok (RC controller only). I added the Jdrones telemetry radios so I could have more info displayed during my next planned test flight. During this next test flight (stabilize mode)  the drone went into a crazy death wobble and flipped over during take off. Lucky the few second flight was at a low altitude so only the carbon fiber props were damaged and the top cover of the drone. Please note - During this crash I was only using the throttle control to take off. I’m a newbie when it comes to the pixhawk and analyzing the flight data but I noticed the compass info go way off during acceleration of the motors so possibly interference causing the problem?? If this is the case I’m not sure why the first few tests were o.k. This may be some helpful info but after the first test i attempted to re calibrate the compass and had issues with MP freezing during the calibration. Eventually I got it to work but compass # 2 had some large Z vale of -460 but from what I read it uses compass 1. After the crash its now giving a prearm error of inconsistent compasses. The pixhawk also wont always power up with battery power now but after multiple tries it will work. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

What I should have explained, is that these plots we created when the quad is sitting on a bench, without props (FC setting on standard, no loiter or alt.hold).

That way you can progressively work your way through the flight mode’s that rely more on the flight controller. Stabilize is all on you and is recommended as a fall back flight mode in case thing’s go wrong for that reason.

Setting it back to 500 should bring your throttle in and out should match exactly in stabilize, but only if you can. The idea is that setting compensates for an under/over powered craft so that mid throttle in stabilize means the craft doesn’t suddenly shoot up or fall down. Apart from that, you really need to try flying it and if it still tries tipping over get the log up. Some people say that just going for full throttle to get in the air as quick as possible is best. Personally I raise the throttle slowly and just let the quad lift up steadily.

It needs some pitch corrections during take off to prevent it from tipping over, but once it is airborne, it flies really smoothly. The stabilize mode was not programmed under a switch in the RTF donor that I used parts from to build this thing. That is why I never tried (nor considered) it. Thanks MarkM for pushing me in the right direction! What I find interesting/disturbing, is that when I change the flight mode from stabilize to alt.hold or loiter, the Quad looses power, as if the throttle is tuned down. It loses altitude until I give more power using the throttle. In these modes, the quad is much slower. Is this a setting that can be changed?

What is wrong, broken or misused by the noob? *","From what I can see, your throttle is at around 33-40% in stabilize mode when you change to alt hold/loiter. When you change to these mode’s the throttle stick becomes an altitude stick, so the throttle has to be in the centre in order to maintain altitude. As you were at 33-40% the uav think’s you’re telling it to descend. What you need to do is get the uav up to a reasonable height and maintain a hover at that height for at least 10-20seconds but the longer the better really, and it has to be in stabilize. When done, load up the log and show altitude and throttle in, you should see a nice flat line in the altitude where you were hovering it. At the same point in the log have a look at the throttle input, I’m guessing it’s going to be 300-400. What ever that number is, you set the THR_MID parameter to and save the parameter’s You should find then that the uav will only start taking off when your at/above mid throttle and that you can hover the uav at mid throttle. Switching to alt hold, loiter etc should not change the uav’s height when you do so after getting that parameter set. It might take a couple of goes to get it just right but if you keep repeating the process you will get there. Loiter is a restricted mode designed for video work (in my opinion) and you would be better using Position Hold instead. It hold’s position like loiter when you let go of the stick’s but fly’s around like altitude hold.",1427,17,0,280,21h,766,3.8k,0,3,6,447,1,0

848,190,Quadcopter gained height really quick in AltHold and then crashed,2,1078,1,"Hello ardupilot community, I’ve just build my first quadcopter and did my first really low level flights (around 5 meters) successfully, so I’ve wanted to get a little bit (around 10 meters) higher. After flying in stabilize a bit, I switched to Alt Hold and flew for a minute or so, when suddenly it goes into full throttle and gaines height really quick. I was totally shocked and switched into Land mode as fast as I could (I’m not sure if the land mode that could be seen in log was actually from my side or if that was a failsafe). It then was drifted away by the wind a larger distance and I found it crashed, with a broken arm and 3 broken rotors. I tried to analyse the log a bit for myself and I’ve made the following observations:  VFR_HUD_Throttle goes to 100% suddenly, RC input was transmitting ~ 50 % throttle (See above pic) Altitude (VFR_HUD_alt as well as GPS_relative_alt) dropped below zero shortly AFTER throttle went to 100%. I wasn’t landing or something, it was still in the air Zmag drops really low BEFORE Throttle went to 100%  Pic off the log.  Other observations, they don’t seem so important though:  For me it looked like it dropped really fast after that, but in the log you can see a smooth declination. I’m pretty sure that the log is cut of at the end unfortunaly. I’m not sure how to see events in this log though PIC  Relative alt and VFR_HUD_alt have an offset after switching to land The throttle goes really far down after initiating Land and it doesn’t goes up a little bit to inititiate a smoother landing.  Seems to be the cut off log as well. Vibration is higher than allowed, but i can’t seem to find a correlation between zacc, yacc & xacc with the Full Throttle PIC   Infos about my build:  APM 2.6 with sponge on barometer external compass with GPS, but it isn’t working in most cases EMAX 4in1 ESC  Picture of my quadcopter when it was still fine  Unfortunaley, I wasn’t able to get a complete .log/.bin file of it, I only had the *.tlog from the “3dr Services” app on my android tablet. I was flying in windy conditions as well, maybe it has something to do with that. I also have to add that the apm is not really vibration resistant, as described above, because the foam isn’t delivered yet and I only wanted to make a low level test flight. * Could you help me with this, what exactly was causing the full throttle? I’m assuming it’s because of the dropped Zmag, but I’m not sure what caused it (and what exactly it is). Do you need the tlog I have? Or are the pics enough?

After flying in stabilize a bit, I switched to Alt Hold and flew for a minute or so, when suddenly it goes into full throttle and gaines height really quick. I was totally shocked and switched into Land mode as fast as I could (I’m not sure if the land mode that could be seen in log was actually from my side or if that was a failsafe). It then was drifted away by the wind a larger distance and I found it crashed, with a broken arm and 3 broken rotors. I tried to analyse the log a bit for myself and I’ve made the following observations:  VFR_HUD_Throttle goes to 100% suddenly, RC input was transmitting ~ 50 % throttle (See above pic) Altitude (VFR_HUD_alt as well as GPS_relative_alt) dropped below zero shortly AFTER throttle went to 100%. I wasn’t landing or something, it was still in the air Zmag drops really low BEFORE Throttle went to 100%  Pic off the log.  Other observations, they don’t seem so important though:  For me it looked like it dropped really fast after that, but in the log you can see a smooth declination. I’m pretty sure that the log is cut of at the end unfortunaly. I’m not sure how to see events in this log though PIC  Relative alt and VFR_HUD_alt have an offset after switching to land The throttle goes really far down after initiating Land and it doesn’t goes up a little bit to inititiate a smoother landing.  Seems to be the cut off log as well. Vibration is higher than allowed, but i can’t seem to find a correlation between zacc, yacc & xacc with the Full Throttle PIC   Infos about my build:  APM 2.6 with sponge on barometer external compass with GPS, but it isn’t working in most cases EMAX 4in1 ESC  Picture of my quadcopter when it was still fine  Unfortunaley, I wasn’t able to get a complete .log/.bin file of it, I only had the *.tlog from the “3dr Services” app on my android tablet. I was flying in windy conditions as well, maybe it has something to do with that. I also have to add that the apm is not really vibration resistant, as described above, because the foam isn’t delivered yet and I only wanted to make a low level test flight. * Could you help me with this, what exactly was causing the full throttle? I’m assuming it’s because of the dropped Zmag, but I’m not sure what caused it (and what exactly it is). Do you need the tlog I have? Or are the pics enough? I’m also trying at the moment to get the *log file, but it’s a little bit bugged. Thank you very much in advance. Greetings, Thomas","I was actually using a APM, so it isn’t possible. Logs aren’t working, no idea why; but that’s another problem. My quadrocopter was just a little bit misconstructed (I build him myself; no xp with rc before); calibrating the compass and APM after that fixed the problem, I’ve never experienced such a thing again. I also learned that you always should be able to switch to Stabilize on your remote, which helped me a lot.",421,110,0,2,20m,9,23,0,0,1,2,1,1

These smaller more agile quads are far more sensitive to tuning, so are more difficult to initially tune.  Starting PIDs are key, as Leonard suggests in link from previous comment start with half or quarter of default PIDs (for P,I and D values). THR_MID also very important to set as most of these smaller quads seems to be hugely overpowered (as in have a much higher than ‘normal’ 50% hover ratio). They are very sensitive to wind, at least mine is with quite a large main body relative to size.  Therefore much more difficult to autotune unless there is absolutely no wind. I started with less aggressive autotune (0.1) then went to 0.75 then to 0.5.  0.5 produces higher PIDs which seem much more dialled in for me.

The flight was conducted indoors with all gains known to have worked before.  This was the second flight for the day (flown in stabilise). At 291.4 s, the quad was switched to AltHold.

I was simply loitering IRIS+ approximately 4 meters above ground. I expected failsafe battery to trigger LAND, because FS_BATT_ENABLE was set to 1:LAND. Instead, the copter climbed approximately to 20-30 meters and flew away from Home location, then crashed. Even if the copter would specifically RTL, (as noted for the FS_BATT_VOLTAGE) then it still should have landed at the same location anyway, as it was ARMED their, instead, as noted above, it flew away from RTL location.

Regards, Vusal",It looks like it is.  The problem here is that the IRIS+ does not have a Stabilize flight mode to use.  Both Loiter and Altitude Hold and Position Hold relay on the accelerometer for flight.  I think on the IRIS+ they label it STD mode which is actually Altitude Hold. What would be nice is to do a test hover for a few minutes and check the vibration to see if there is still a problem.

901,207,"IRIS+ hovered in Loiter mode, FailSafeBatt-1 triggered, copter climbed and crashed",11,1665,11,"1) Describe the problem you are having. What is the expected verses the observed behavior? I was simply loitering IRIS+ approximately 4 meters above ground. I expected failsafe battery to trigger LAND, because FS_BATT_ENABLE was set to 1:LAND. Instead, the copter climbed approximately to 20-30 meters and flew away from Home location, then crashed. Even if the copter would specifically RTL, (as noted for the FS_BATT_VOLTAGE) then it still should have landed at the same location anyway, as it was ARMED their, instead, as noted above, it flew away from RTL location. The moment it climbed up I did switch CH7 ON to force Land, but it didn’t help. I was having issues with compass and then accelerometer calibration, but I re-calibrated everything from scratch and had no Pre-Arm Errors. 2) Provide hardware information such as the brand and version of your autopilot, GPS, radio, and compass, as well as any other pertinent details about your setup. 3DR Iris+, Pixhawk/PX4, 3DR UBlox GPS + Compass Module, 2.4Ghz FrSky D4R-II 4 Channel Telemetry Receiver and FrSky DJT Telemetry Transmitter, 433 Mhz 3DR Telemetry Radio for Tower (was connected when crashed) 3) What version of the APM:Copter firmware version are you running?

I’m new in this forum, also new in flying/modding quadcopters and, to make it even worse, English is not my mother tongue (so please, please, be patient :-s) Bought a CX-20 (with APM) a few weeks ago,  and after a few short trial flights (and of course some glue and spare parts) I downloaded the dataflash logs to analyze them. I was very surprised to discover that the CX-20 can travel through hyperspace, jumping from Spain to the middle on the Atlantic Ocean and back some hundreds of times in ten minutes. In spite of the fact that I’m trying to fit seats on it for my wife and I and spend next weekend in Jamaica, I am curious about this amazing skill of a 240€ aircraft (I bet Lando Calrissian paid a lot more for the Millenium Falcon). Any help will be very appreciated. In the logs, latitude jumps about 0,21° (23,33km)  and/or longitude jumps about 53,69° (almost 6000km) each time, to immediately return to the actual position. The flight experience was not affected at all, didn’t notice anything that looked strange (to a newbie as me). The quad was responsive and more or less stable in all modes, including loiter. After editing the log (erasing the lines with wrong lat. or long.) I succeeded to make a new kmz file that showed my actual drunk-hornet style flight path. I tried a mod I found in Youtube, moving GPS to the roof of the upper hull and covering it with aluminum tape, but obtained the same jumps. If I can find how to do it, I’ll upload some screenshots and the corresponding log. Best regards.

The thing is that although I don’t have battery monitor, when I retrieve the drone from a tree I checked both batteries, they where full,the drone flew like 4 minutes before the event. I think I’ve trace the problem  to failsafe bad configuration. As I didn’t have any apm failsafe there was an in-flight loss of TX and the failsafe of the receiver kicked in( crappy orange r615), failsafe might have maintained the position of throttle on which it was first binded with,low throttle on GPS control.

Then I switched to a larger samsung camera and a bigger gimbal. So I had to redo the autotune process. With the GoPro the ESCs had the simonK firmware installed. But I had to switch one of the ESCs and didn’t know the firmware version and settings of the other ESCs. And because I had great results with BlHeli on my mini quad I installed BlHeli on all six ESCs with the same settings. Today I went out flying and enabled autotune (yaw-axis) which worked perfectly.

BUT I tried again and could complete the auto tune process without any problem. So there is no syncing issue anymore! After auto tune was complete it had tuned down the PIDs drastically and it was nearly unflyable. Roll was all over the place and had completely lost its “locked in” feeling. But I wasn’t able to get it to crash again. “Tied” it till the battery was empty. The flying weight is absolutely maxed out with the Samsung camera and I have a theory why it crashed despite the syncing issue has been solved. On a hexacopter there are TWO motors in the front and in the back to manage the pitch-axis but only ONE motor on either side to control the roll-axis. So I think that with my fast roll inputs in stabilized mode it hadn’t enough power to stabilize roll and crashed. When I activated autotune (hovering wasn’t an issue) it tuned down the PIDs so much that it got totally soft/wobbely/spngy but was able to hold it in the air without falling from the sky. Because with the low PIDs it wasn’t possible to accelerate the hexacopter so fast on the roll axis that it wasn’t able to stop the movement. Until now I flew with 12x4.5 propelllers and now I switched to 13x4. Hopefully that is enought to get enough power to fly it like it should. The motors will have no problem with it as they came down completely coll with the 12x4.5 and others fly those motors with 14"" propellers.

This is what has thrown me as I could not understand what would cause such a roll after stable flight and part way through the auto tune. I now have the copter back together and ready to test again so I will be able to verify the failed motor theory.",521,42,0,1.8k,13d,3.9k,26.2k,159,281,38,1.7k,0.6667,0

Please help with crash report!,1,821,1,"Hi had a a very scary fly away - i’d really appreciate a second pair of eyes ( or more) at the logs to try and work out what on earth happened- as I’m a bit too scared to fly again until I’m happy this won’t happen again! [attachment=0]2016-03-19 16-24-48.log[/attachment] Brief overview from real world: I flew one battery worth of flight, everything as normal,  put in second battery, armed, took off in stabilise mode. almost immediately affter leaving the ground it was not responding . I think it clipped ground and then the hex then began to spiral and gain altitude to about 150m, while heading away from me. ( it looked as if the battery had become dislodged and was upsetting the balance. I tried cycling to other modes/ alt hold/ rtl, landing to no effect. at which point i began runnign after the hex, with my throttle at 0 hoping to crash. It continued flying over empty football pitches, over a rugby game, tress and was then obscured by trees, my wife saw it then plummet and it landed neatly between trees and a towpath next to a canal. Lipo was still attached, motors beeping in error. I was terrified that this was going to hit a person/vehicle/ head off into residential areas with no option to ditch. there was a failsafe set on my receiver which should switch it to landing mode and a low throttle- perhaps this was engaged, but perhaps the throttle was too high? perhaps the quad was trying to stabilise once the battery was knocked loose, by throttling up? Perhaps there was interference somehow ( i’ve flown this field before many times without issue) there was surprisingly little damage ( as far as I can tell so far) The landing gear was totaled, and I broke a boom arm, but everything else seems intact - so hopefully technically an easy repair. [attachment=0]2016-03-19 16-24-48.log[/attachment] if anyone could take a look at this log and try to fathom what has happened i would be most grateful. So far this is what i’m reading- gps logged correctly (until crash) - route is terrifyingly mapped; actual flight mode never changed. throttle in/out was very quickly on at a constant 370  it appeared to still be on when it dropped out the sky which is confusing, but so glad it did! Equipment overview- taranis x9d x8d receiver  - fail safe set to land mode - and fairly low throttle - landing gear lowered. apm 2.5 tarot hex frame  680 carbon - rctimer esc and motors custom retracts powered by secondary aux lipo. no gimbal on this flight","there was no mode-change, only one throttle input the whole way, makes me guess for a very bad failsafe setup on RC reciever, like “hold” or predefined positions that are not trigging AP failsafe. there’s very little logged data,  several things like vibrations, RCIN , IMU  - that could help understanding what’s happened, are missing due to config. but your constant throttle in plus the fact there was no mode change, hells me this was RC related, combined with poor(useless) failsafe setup.",494,0,0,1.3k,4d,1.4k,8.4k,19,144,106,1.3k,1,0

I have three APM2.6 that show all the same problem as follows:  Copter perfectly levelled according to artificial horizon, RC calibrated, voltage > 11V RC channels remapped, 1=Throttle, 2=Roll, 3=Pitch, 4=Yaw --> works as it’s supposed to be No compass (but problems also there with compass) if powered up, armed and throttle up the  copter tilts to the right side (all three boards in the same angle), Mot 2+3 runs far higher if the copter levelled by hand, the right side motors (1 + 4) almost stop while 2 + 3 run with high revs if copter tilted to the right side by hand 1 + 4 accelerate parameters (chXout) show 1162 on all motors in idle with full throttle and copter kept levelled, motors chXout show  right handside motors are lower although copter is levelled! I changed the ESCs from left to right, the problem remained the same I had all the three APM 2.6 working well with previous firmware versions and one of it even with 3.2.1. I’m currently downloading a log file, the size is very large, I hope I can upload it here later. Please see the attached images of the horizon and the parameter status at full throttle (ch1in). I don’t know what could have happened and what ist the reason but it’s driving me nuts. Please help, thanks in advance! Robert ","Hi again, I’m getting more and more hopeless with my APMs and the QC firmware. I bought a VR Micro Brain in order to be compliant for FW versions > 3.2.1. I was hoping that the issue with the roll offset would resolve then but with QC3.3.3 on the new controller, the same thing happened again. I changed the RC sender and receiver but this didn’t fix the problem (as I expected since the RC signals are displayed corrrect in Mission Planner). The calibration, of course, was done. The horizon is also perfectly levelled, so again, I don’t have a clue why the motor outputs 2 and 3 (left motors) are substantially higher than on the right side. Just as with the APMs, the copter tilts right. I can’t imagine the problem comes from a failure in the controller or the software. I tried three APM2.6, one APM Mini and a VR Micro Brain as well as firmware versions from 3.2 to 3.3.3. Again, I kindly ask for your advice, I can’t solve the issue on my own. Thank you!

I further went as to balance the bells on the motors as well. That made a huge improvement in performance, especially with alt hold and pos hold…There are plenty of videos on that. In your picture the rubber band is just tightening the flight controller closer the vibrations. Hence why it got worst… You may also ain’t to  look into some Kyosho Zeal Tape.  I have read that a little goes along way. Every frame and setup is different so it’s very difficult to say exactly the problem. I say start with your balancing and check your logs after and compare them to before.

Then briefly your sat count halved from 8 to 4 and your HDOP went from 2.14 to 16.25 before going back to 6 sats and 2.16. Then it went really wrong and you lost all GPS, no satellites at all resulting in a GPS glitch, then you dropped throttle which was followed by GPS failsafe and a LAND command. After that there’s a failed attempt to go into DRIFT mode, followed by the quad dropping to -8mtr (below ground level), a BARO error and then a CRASH DETECTION. Look’s to me like your GPS signal was rubbish to start with and then went completely which meant the quad thought it was nowhere near where it actually was and was trying to get back.

Thanks in advance Steve","You could lose GPS lock for a number of reasons. Intermittent wiring connection, solar activity, flying in a built up area. The number of satellites is a good indicator and so is the HDOP, low sat and high HDOP is bad. What GPS are you currently using? I’ve been using the Drotek M8N for over a year now without any issues. I think the brownout is a false reading from the auto analysis. After the flight; the log show you were doing other things with the quad for almost an hour. When you finally unplugged it the barometer had a false reading of being 30mtr up. Losing power at altitude is reported as a brown out. It may be down to your settings, or a glitch in the matrix as to why it flew off. When you started the flight you had a good GPS lock which gave accurate position information to the flight controller. As the GPS signal dropped the position accuracy also drops meaning the FC now thinks it’s potentially hundred’s of miles away from where it’s supposed to be. It’s reaction to that is to fly back to the position it should be in hence the sudden fly away. I thought there was GPS Glitch protection to stop that, so not 100% sure. Have you tried changing the firmware? A friend of mine had issues with 3.2.1 on a tricopter (constantly banked right) but was perfect on 3.2",1286,4,0,280,21h,766,3.8k,0,3,6,447,1,0

When looking at the desired position (DPosX and DPosY) I notice that it suddenly changed at about (if not exactly) the time the landing started.

1004,252,"Flight with very poor control, minimal response to throttle",1,1068,1,"Hey fellas, I have had an interesting situation. My pixhawk hex has been flying beautifully with the turnigy 9x radio with the 9xtreme board. I’ve upgraded to the Taranis x9D plus, to unlock 16 channels. I’d also updated to the 3.3.3 rc2 firmware, and redid the drone calibration (as I do for every firmware upgrade) First test flight today, and things go crazy. Great GPS lock, started up the thing in loiter. From the get go something was wrong. Stick inputs were very delayed and ‘dulled’ for a lack of a better descriptor, and it just flew off on its own in a straight direction. I changed to RTL to see if autonomous mode it could come back, but it still kept flying away. Changed to Stabilize to manually bring it back, which it kind of responded to. Got low to ground, reduced throttle but it was descending too rapidly so I bumped up the throttle which it seemed to respond too. Flight was still erratic, so I shut throttle down to 0 as I wasn’t sure if it was going to go off again and couldn’t risk that. It landed, but then suddenly powered back up and flipped. Looking at the hexa, none of the APC blades were damaged Even with loiter and stabilise the drone was in an almost manual like mode i.e. not stable. It required a lot of effort to bring down I have no idea what happened. This is bizarre, as the pixhawk has been flying beautifully before. I’ve added a link to the log, and it would be great if someone could please shed light on what could have happened.  Log shows mid way through something happens with regards to vibration, which might explain why it did strange things. However, from the get go on launching the drone, the flying was already very strange, and erratic.  * Today’s flight was to achieve 2 things: 1 - properly calibrate the voltage and current module as they have been off for a while and I had been using an external to the pixhawk telemetry to measure voltage and current 2 - to do a mag calibration with motors at max as I’ve just received my 3dr v2 radio Radio has been calibrated, as has the compass/accel. 6 flight modes have been programmed using logical switches linked to physical switches, all modes switched well when testing via usb tethering to the pixhawk.

1005,253,GPS loss after several minutes of flight,1,712,1,"So I have been battling this for the last 2 weeks.  After 2-5 minutes of flight GPS HDOP climbs rapidly and NSATS falls, sometimes to zero.  The Pixhawk, GPS, and Telemetry modules + all cables have all been replaced and the exact same symptoms persist.  Actual GPS reception is good during the event, I had my small Garmin sitting on the table and it experienced no such loss of signal.  On one flight, I lost GPS @ 2 minutes or so.  EKF refused to go back to POS HOLD but after the loss and recovery of signal, the remaining 45 minutes of flight had no GPS issues.  I am at a loss.  After dozens of builds and hundreds of flight hours I have gotten to a problem that I cannot solve through research or isolate through testing.

1006,254,"Loiter mode climb, drift and crash!",1,597,1,"Hello, This is my first post as I have done quite well ‘so far’ with my hex build (Tarot 680 Pro with Pioxhawk). Today was the first day I flew her and to be honest, became quite emotional!   First of all I thought I would go out and test my build gently and hover a couple of metres above the ground, just so I would get used to it and look for any obvious problems. Things didn’t start so well as straight away it wouldn’t arm and notifying an ‘Accelerometer Not Healthy’ message. I then rebooted and it was fine. I proceeded to arm and hover in Stabilize mode but for some reason the drone would fly forward. Now I have a gimbal mounted as far as the front props but my battery is far back enough to balance it out. Maybe this will be ironed out by tuning, I don’t know. I then landed and changed the flight mode to Loiter. I was able to hover the drone at about 2m for a good few minutes but then suddenly it started to climb, higher and higher until it was I’d say 20m in the air. It then started to drift across the field I was flying but gradually descended around an area with trees where it then slowly came back down through the trees. Luckily nothing broke! Now I do recall hearing loud beeps (several fast beeps and then maybe 2 a second) just before it started to climb. Looking back at the logs I can see I must’ve changed the mode to RTL as an initial reaction, so maybe that was it. But it’s probably a failsafe mode that I can’t work out as it makes no sense. (I’ve attached all logs) I’ve had a look at the logs and all altitudes match, there is a sudden drop in baro pressure which is leading me to think that could be the culprit. The drone also seemed to vibrate a fair bit and in the Auto Analyse log file there are a few errors. Could anyone have a quick look at my log files or share some wisdom? I’m not sure why there is a battery error code as post crash my battery read 14v. Any thoughts?

Bought an Iris+ last month from the Xmas cash. I have done a few test flights so far and really happy with the results. Had to tweak some inputs on the Tarot Gimbal and was happy to trust the follow me mode while using the Airwheel, since the test earlier was perfectly good. RTL was spot on! So, connecting the tower app (samsung Galaxy S2) with the Iris. Starting it up and let it go to the sky. Immediately flying away… oops. Took over the control and brought it back. Do the sequence again and all looked fine. Started the follow me mode with the standard mode, no changes to the parameters. Started the Airwheel and played with some modes: follow right, follow loiter, changed the altitude a bit lower etc. Video is here, for some reason it stopped filming and it did not recorded the crash. But you can see there are some glitches is following me. The it suddenly went for the RTL mode. I dont know why, maybe I pressed the button (?). I cancelled it, because I just started the flight and pressed “follow me” again. Then it drifted away back, sort of RTL look-a-like and crased into the ground. I see a GPS-loss in the logs and a los of TX/RX (?), but can someone with experience please look at the log and tell me what went wrong and how I can avoid this in the future?

Ed","Well, your MAG.MagX,Y,Z did not log anything - most likely you did not had an working magnetometer at all.  reading the compass then would give VERY bad data. A multirotor depends very much on magnetometer for assisted flight.  As you discovered yourself; safety check on ArduCopter are there for a reason, this is some of the big differences between serious autopilots and toys. Disabling them may be necessary for complex operations (like when you need to take off from a somewhat magnetic steel surface(ship), or other lots of iron in ground) - then we take off in stabilize , and always try the UAV very well while airborne in f.eksample Loiter , before using AUTO, or expecting a mission. It’s not very good idea to disable mag checks, and then switch to a mode that needs that data. If you did not chose to switch to RTL, but Stabilize, you would be able to save the day. Make sure you learn to fly well in stabilize, do not be dependent on assisted modes, if you felt comfortable in stabilized, you’d switch to that in a situation where you suspected AP’s ability.",1071,2,0,1.3k,4d,1.4k,8.4k,19,144,106,1.3k,1,0

But in my still learning of quads, I mistakenly assumed that the compass was more for nose heading while the GPS was more for position.  I am VERY lucky to have only damaged my quad and lipo and nothing else.  A mistake I will never make again.  I am comfortable flying in any mode as I fly helis and planes as well, but I seem to have be startled by what was happening that I switched to RTL in a panic.

I have a FRSky Lipo meter that sends back voltage data to my radio which I can log.  The PX power module ALWAYS reads low when I’m loading the copter.  Even in a hover it still reads low.

When I download the log from Pixhawk (running Copter 3.3) using mavlink in Mission Planner (v1.3.32) it is assigned a file name using the date and time of the download, not of the mission, which already indicates a problem I think. When I review the log in Mission Planner the data/time column shows 0001-01-01 00:00:00.000 throughout. The same happens if I choose to review the mavlink downloaded BIN file in MP after it goes through the auto convert to LOG. And the same also with the BIN file copied directly from the SD card.

When I changed all the GPS status values to 3 using a text editor, then Mission Planner recognised the dates in the log file, and the geotagging worked. The GPS was operating perfectly well in terms of position, HDOP etc. I’m using a Neo8 compass/GPS module. (or at least I think I am - that’s what I ordered but I don’t know how to check that’s what it really is) I’ve noticed in two subsequent logs that the GPS status changed from 3 to 4 mid flight bit this seems not to have caused Mission Planner a problem, perhaps because the initial GPS readings were accepted so it could figure out the time. I’ve not tinkered around further to check if this is true. Any suggestions as to why value of 4 was logged? Does this suggest a bug somewhere? I’ll mark this one as solved and raise a new question about the logging of value 4 for GPS status.",1015,1,0,0,< 1m,0,10,0,0,5,5,1,1

Today I went out to try the quad after I had successfully completed Autotune from yesterday and a crash with the same symptom. During the first flight with 1st battery, no gimbal/camera, the quad came back and landed without a problem as I was testing the RTL midway into the flight. Even when the 1st battery hit the failsafe level, the quad came back as I set it to RTL when batt is low. All in all, the 1st flight with the 1st battery went without any problem. I wasn’t flying over 10m above ground and was flying away for maybe about 1 football (soccer) pitch length. No problem there. Then I switched battery, put on the gimbal and camera and went up. This time, I went up to about ~20m around the same field length. As I was flying around, I decided to try the RTL that I set it to CH8 switch for emergency. The quad was the furthest away, both height and distance from where I was standing, maybe around 1.5 football pitch length and 20m up. I flicked the switch (which was calibrated and confirmed working when the quad was not armed by checking the computer screen via tele) and the quad slowly came around, nothing special there. Until it was right above the take-off spot and was descending, then suddenly it pitched to the right quite sharply. I do not know exactly if it was “sharply” or not, but from what I saw, it was quite sharp and quick. I tried to correct it but the quad did not respond to my command. Luckily it crashed in the woods next to the field, nobody was injured, no 3rd party damage, the quad had a few tiny broken pieces, nothing serious. But I am quite baffled why this happened. It’s actually not the first time the quad pitched sharply to the right, ignoring my input, and crashed. It happened yesterday after I completed the Autotune and was on 2nd battery, flying around on AltHold, then the quad did exactly the samething. I thought it was the big transformer I was flying by that caused the flyaway, but today I was at an open field with nothing possible to interfere. The quad did not have a log from yesterday crash, but I’ve got it from today. Tried to look at it but I am quite new, so I’m quite lost of what to look for.

If you look at the RCOUT values in your log, at the same time with the pitch, you can see the pitch starting to go very positive (pitch up). As this is happening your controller is dropping the request for power to your 3 and 5 motors (the front two). So it’s seeing the pitch change and trying to fix it, but fails, even though it drops the power to your front motors to essentially zero. I’d look first at the motors and ESCs for your two rear motors. Could be something intermittent that causes one to lose power. Your controller is asking for more power on both 4 and 6, but especially 4. Another possibility could be sync issues as some have found Pixhawks (and maybe worse for Fixhawks) act oddly with certain models of ESC. And these same ESCs work fine with older APMs. Lastly, it could be some strange hardware problem since it’s a clone as that occasionally comes with the territory.",991,0,0,70,1h,123,608,0,2,7,190,1,0

The way I am experiencing it is completely different (and I dislike it very much), as you can see in the log: When I switch to AltHold mode, the copter is maintaining its climb rate.

1074,289,"Log Analysis help, please",1,499,1,"Good evening - If anyone has a free moment, a little log analysis help would be much appreciated.  I am very new to log analysis, I did indeed read the “common-diagnosing problems using logs” as noted in the ‘please read before posting’.   Problem is, I am real new to this, and it seems I have all 6 problems - I am trying to figure out what the root [if any] problem is.  A brief overview of my flight: First attempt at an auto-mode flight.  Programmed a few waypoints, put it up and let it go.  3 times it ran the route perfectly.  Charge back up the battery, try it again a little before noon.  Noticeable cloud cover and a stiff breeze (~7-8 mph).  Quad takes off, sputters a little on the way up.  Continues nicely, hits first waypoint.  Continues on to the 2nd waypoint, starts falling [appears to be a controlled fall], never recovers and eventually crashes. I see vibrations are a little higher than the previous flight.  GPS HDOP hits 100 at the same time Nsats drops to 0.  DesRoll + Roll, Des Pitch + Pitch, Des Yaw + Yaw all seem good.  Power Issues graph doesn’t turn up anything. I also checked Trimble to see what the satellite situation looked like at the time I flew - all looked good. My question is if I indeed analyzed the log properly (and I’m thinking I am way off because I’m a newb), can a GPS_GLITCH cause the whole thing to fall out of the sky?  I thought AC would switch over to stabilize mode, or something should GPS go away?  Could it have been a giant UFO or something that I didn’t see that confused the heck out of the GPS?   Thanks in advance, John","Wow, lots of views (100), but no responses yet.  Is this in the right place?  Are these logs really this difficult to diagnose?

I also kept the UBEC into the out rail as a back up power and added a zener diode. I am waiting for a mast for the gps and I will elevate it before I fly again. Yes I did read some posts about the PM so I will ignore it. I would really appreciate if  when you have sometime you could have a look at the log and see if you can find what triggered the battery warning and the brownout, I am still lost about it and want be comfortable in testing that big bird if I don’t have a clue about the issue.

1088,298,Brownout fail ?!?,6,1622,3,"Hi there I was testing my huge new build quad-octo, the motors are powered by 4 6s 10000mah, and the Pixhawk and electronics by a 3s 5000mah.

I was pretty happy beside some sloppiness in Stab, for which I thought I would try to low a bit D, Alt Hold was extremely stable and in Loiter it showed a tendency to move in a circle which I am not sure it is because the GPS is mounted on the frame and gets interference, so I was planning to try move it or to mount it on a mast.

Which logs should I look at to analyze the power to the board? The PH  was powered only by a UBEC feeding the out rail, without a zener as my understanding is that you only need the diode if there are servos attached to the rail. There are two PDB on the octo, one distributing 6s batteries to the ESCs  which are connected to the PH with only signal and ground cable, and one distributing a 3s battery to PH, OSD, VTX, rx etc each one with its own BEC. The two PDB have a common ground. I hope this clarify a bit the setup. Thanks a million for the assistance QO",640,4,0,0,< 1m,0,7,0,0,3,4,0.3333,0

It seems to me they happen when the octo is landed and on the ground, while the auto analysis was detecting a brownout at some 5 mt altitude.  I see from your attachment you use Apm P on a MAc, I can’t find how to Auto Analyze a log on Mac. Is there any way to read from the log  if the Pixhawk has switched its power supply from the power port to the out rail back up power? Thanks QC",469,16,0,0,< 1m,0,7,0,0,3,4,1,0
